## Ingredients

- 3 tbs neutral oil, such as sunflower or canola
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2 jalapeños, seeded or not, thinly sliced
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 knob ginger (about 1 inch), minced
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 1½ tsp garam masala
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- ½ tsp ground turmeric
- 2 (440g) cans chickpeas, rinsed
- 1(400ml) can coconut milk (do not use light coconut milk)
- 1 3/4 cups pumpkin purée (~1kg pumpkin)
- 1½ tsps fine sea salt, more as needed
- ¾ cup chopped corriander, more for serving
- 2 to 3tbs fresh lime juice, plus wedges for serving
- Cooked rice or naan, for serving (optional)

## Directions

1. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in onion, jalapeño and bay leaf. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is golden on the edges, about 8 minutes.
2. Add ginger and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in garam masala, cumin and turmeric; cook for an additional 30 seconds.
3. Stir in chickpeas, coconut milk, pumpkin, ½ cup water and 1½ teaspoons salt. Bring to a simmer and continue to simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, to let the flavors meld. (Add more water if it starts to look too thick.) Stir in corriander and lime juice to taste. Taste and add more salt if necessary.
4. Serve over rice or with naan if you like, and top with more corriander and lime wedges on the side.
