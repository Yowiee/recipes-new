## Ingredients

#### Almond Cream:

- 226 g almond flour (2 cups)
- 170 g unsalted butter, room temperature
- 200 g granulated sugar (1 cup)
- 1 1/2 teaspoons orange zest from 2 medium oranges
- 35 g all-purpose flour (1/4 cup)
- 2 large eggs, room temperature
- 2 tablespoons (30 ml) brandy or dark rum, optional
- 1 tablespoon (15 ml) almond extract
- 1 tablespoon (15 ml) vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

#### Brioche:

- Eight (1.5cm thick) slices brioche
- 1/2 cup (60 ml) orange juice from 2 medium oranges
- 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup orange marmalade, divided
- Almond cream, see above
- 60g sliced almonds 

## Directions

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 175°C (165°C fan). Add almond flour to a parchment-lined 20 x 30 cm rimmed baking sheet and spread into a thin, even layer. Toast in oven, stirring every 3 minutes, until the almond flour is fragrant and light golden brown, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes.
2. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat butter, sugar, and orange zest, if using, on low speed to roughly incorporate. Increase to medium-high speed and beat until smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes, pausing to scrape down bowl and beater with a flexible spatula as needed. Add almond flour, all-purpose flour, egg, brandy (if using), almond extract, vanilla extract, and salt. Mix on medium-high speed until smooth, thick, and creamy, pausing to scrape down bowl and beater halfway through, about 2 minutes. Using a flexible spatula, scrape bowl and beater to ensure that no streaks of unmixed butter remain. (Almond cream can also be prepared in a large bowl with an electric hand mixer.)
3. Arrange brioche slices on a 13- by 18-inch rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment. In a small bowl, whisk orange juice and vanilla extract to combine. Brush both sides of 1 slice of brioche with orange juice mixture. Using an offset spatula, spread 1 tablespoon orange marmalade evenly across brioche. Top with about 3 tablespoons almond cream, spreading evenly from side to side to cover bread. Garnish with sliced almonds. Repeat with remaining brioche slices.
4. Bake until almond cream is a light golden brown and just firm to the touch, about 20 minutes. Let cool for 5
