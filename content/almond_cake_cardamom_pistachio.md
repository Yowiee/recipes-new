## Ingredients

- ½ cup vegetable oil, plus additional for pan
- 7 large eggs, separated
- 120g sugar
- 420 grams almond flour (see tip)
- 3 tsp almond extract
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1.5 tsp ground cardamom
- 2 tablespoons confectioners’ sugar, for dusting
- 3 tablespoons finely chopped pistachio nuts, for garnish

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 160°C. Oil a 22cm round and set aside. Using a stand mixer, whisk egg whites until stiff but not dry, and set aside.
2. In a medium bowl, combine egg yolks and sugar, and whisk to blend. Whisk in almond extract and oil. Add almond flour and cardamom. Gently stir a third of the whites into the batter, then gently fold in the rest until just incorporated.
3. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 50-60 minutes. Allow to cool for 10 minutes, then remove from pan and finish cooling on a rack. To decorate, dust with confectioners’ sugar and chopped pistachios.
