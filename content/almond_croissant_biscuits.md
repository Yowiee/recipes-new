## Ingredients

#### Almond filling:
- 2 cups almond flour (200g)
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar (175g)
- 1 large egg
- 3 tbsp unsalted butter, melted (42g)
- 2 tsp rum (or vanilla extract)
- 1/2 tsp almond extract

#### Cookie dough:
- 2 sticks unsalted butter, melted (226g)
- 1 cup + 2 tbsp granulated sugar (220g)
- 1/2 cup powdered sugar (50g), plus more for garnishing
- 1 large egg
- 1 tsp almond extract
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- 3 cups all-purpose flour (390g)
- 1 cup sliced almonds

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 170Â°C. 
2. Make the almond filling : In a medium bowl, whisk the egg. Using a spatula, mix in the almond flour, sugar, rum, almond extract, and butter. Refrigerate until ready to use.  
3. Make the cookie dough: In a large bowl, add the butter, sugar, and powdered sugar. Mix with a spatula until combined. Mix in the egg, almond extract, baking soda, and salt until well-combined. Add the flour and stir until no dry spots remain. 
4. Assemble the cookies: Using a quarter-cup ice cream scoop, portion out the cookie dough into balls and set on a plate or tray. Remove the almond filling from the refrigerator. Take a cookie dough ball and flatten it into a pancake. Using a two-tablespoon cookie scoop, scoop the almond and plop it into the center of the dough pancake. Envelope the cookie dough around the almond filling and roll until smooth. Repeat for all dough balls. Take the sliced almonds and press them into the top of each dough ball.  Refrigerate the cookies until oven is preheated. 
5. Bake: Add 8 dough balls to a parchment-lined half-sheet tray. Bake for 14-16 minutes, until the cookies are just turning golden at the edge. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes. Remove cookies to a plate or wire rack. Dust with powdered sugar. Repeat baking process with remaining cookies.
