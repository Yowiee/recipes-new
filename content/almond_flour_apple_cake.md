## Ingredients

#### Streusel topping:
- 1/4 cup (40g) gluten-free 1-to-1 baking flour
- 1/4 cup (60g) brown sugar, packed
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 2 tablespoons plant-based butter, cold and cubed

#### Cake:
- 2 1/2 cups (260g) blanched almond flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 3 large eggs, room temperature
- 1/2 cup (110g) cane sugar
- 1/4 cup (60ml) olive oil
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 small apple

#### Glaze:
- 1/2 cup (70g) powdered sugar, sifted
- 3–4 teaspoons unsweetened almond milk

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 180°C. Grease an 8-inch springform pan and line the bottom with parchment paper.
2 Make the streusel topping by adding the 1-to-1 baking flour, brown sugar, cinnamon and butter to a small bowl. Use a fork, pastry cutter or your fingers to mix together the ingredients until crumbly. Place in the fridge until ready to use.
3 Use the medium holes on a box grater to grate the apple. You will need 1/2 cup or 85g of grated apple. Wrap the grated apple in a paper towel and squeeze out some of the juice. The grated apple should weigh 55g after the juice is squeezed out. Set aside.
4 In a large bowl, whisk together the almond flour, cinnamon, baking powder and salt.
5 In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, sugar, oil and vanilla.
6 Add the wet ingredients to the dry mixture and stir until just combined.
7 Fold the grated apple into the cake batter. Do not add in the excess apple juice.
8 Add the batter to your prepared pan and use an offset spatula to spread it out evenly. (The batter will be thick).
9 Evenly scatter the streusel mixture on top of the batter.
10Bake for 28-32 minutes, or until a tooth pick inserted into the middle comes out clean.
11Let cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing the sides and transferring it to a wire rack to fully cool.
12In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar and almond milk and drizzle it over the cake.
