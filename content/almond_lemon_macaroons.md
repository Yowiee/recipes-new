## Ingredients

- 225g almond meal
- 125g white sugar
- 2 egg whites
- Finely grated zest of 1 lemon
- 15 blanched almonds for decoration, halved length ways

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 160°C. Line a large baking sheet with baking parchment. Put the ground almonds, sugar and lemon zest in a large mixing bowl and mix to combine.
2. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until foamy, then add to the almond and sugar mixture. Stir well – it will form a slightly sticky mixture but should hold its shape.
3. Wet your hands lightly and roll a heaped teaspoon of the mixture into a ball between your palms – it should be about 4cm in diameter. Put on the tray and flatten slightly with wet fingers to a thick disc, leaving at least 3cm between each biscuit. Press half a blanched almond into each one.
4. Bake for 15-18 mins until just starting to turn golden around the edges, then remove from the oven and leave to cool on a wire rack. You want them to have a chewy, soft centre and the darker they get the harder the middle will be.
