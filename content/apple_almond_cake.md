## Ingredients

- 160 grams salted butter soft
- 220 grams granulated sugar + 2 tablespoons for topping
- 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 teaspoon almond extract
- 4 eggs large, room temperature
- 125 grams almond flour blanched
- 125 grams all purpose flour
- 1.5 teaspoons baking powder
- 30 grams sliced almonds
- 3 large apples or 4 small
- 3 tablespoon lemon juice

## Directions

#### Prep the Apples
1. Core the apples, cut them in half, then slice them into 1/4" thick slices.
2. Add 4/5 of the total apples into a bowl along with the lemon juice and toss to combine. Set aside the remaining apple slices for the topping.

#### Cake Batter
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C/160°C (fan) and place a rack in the center of the oven.
2. Line a 23cm metal round pan, springform if you have it, with parchment paper or a baking spray with flour in it. In a large mixing bowl, add in the butter, sugar, salt, vanilla and almond extracts.
3. Beat on medium high speed for 2 minutes until light and fluffy.
4. Add in the eggs, one at a time, mixing completely before adding the next. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl in between each egg. Add in the almond flour and mix again until smooth.
5. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl again. Pour in the all purpose flour and baking powder and mix again on medium speed for about 30 seconds until combined. 
6. Add the apple slices tossed in lemon juice into the cake batter, don't pour any excess lemon juice into the batter.
7. Use a flat rubber spatula to disperse the apple slices into the batter.

#### Bake the cake
1. Pour the apple cake batter into the prepared pan and smooth out the top.
2. Fan out the remaining apple slices on top of the cake. Sprinkle the areas between the apple slices with sliced almonds and then sprinkle the whole cake with 2 tablespoons of sugar.
3. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, then rotate and bake for another 20-30 minutes until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center, comes out clean.
4. Place the baked cake on a wire rack to cool for ten minutes. Then run a knife along the edge between the cake and the pan.
5. Remove the spring form or tip the cake out of the pan. Leave to cool completely on a piece of parchment paper on a wire rack.
6. Serve as is or dust with powdered sugar and a dollop of whipped cream.
