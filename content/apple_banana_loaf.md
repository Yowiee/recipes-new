## Ingredients

- 2 medium apples, grated
- 2 bananas, mashed
- 2 eggs
- 75g caster sugar
- 75g dark brown sugar
- 100ml vegetable oil
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 150g self-raising flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- ¼ tsp salt

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 190°C (170°C fan).  Grease and line a 1.2-litre loaf-tin with baking paper. In a large bowl, combine the apple and banana, then stir in the eggs and sugars together. Mix in the vegetable oil and vanilla extract, then gently fold in the flour, baking powder and salt to create a batter.
2. Transfer to the tin and bake for about 50 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Allow to cool in the tin for 10 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.
