## Ingredients

#### Apple Cake:
- 3½ cups all-purpose flour (420g)
- 1¼ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon grated nutmeg
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- 2¼ cups granulated sugar (450g)
- 1½ cups vegetable oil (360ml)
- 3 large eggs
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 3 cups peeled, cored, and diced apples (I like Granny Smith or Honeycrisp) (380g)
- ½ cup chopped walnuts (75g)

#### Glaze:
- ½ cup unsalted butter (113g)
- ½ cup packed light brown sugar (110g)
- ¼ cup heavy cream (60ml)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 170°C. Spray a 10-cup bundt pan with nonstick baking spray.
2. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt.
3. In another large mixing bowl, whisk together the granulated sugar, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla until well combined. Pour into the flour mixture and stir together just until no streaks of flour remain. (The batter will be very thick, but don’t worry! The cake will come out delicious and tender). Fold in the apples and walnuts.
4. Scoop the batter into the prepared Bundt pan and smooth out the top with a spatula. Place a folded kitchen towel on the counter or a cutting board and lightly tap the bundt pan on the towel 5 to 10 times to help settle the batter into the pan.
5. Bake for about 60 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted near the center comes out with a few moist crumbs. Let cool in the pan for 15 minutes. Carefully invert onto a wire rack and cool completely.

#### Glaze:
1. In a small saucepan, combine the butter, brown sugar, and heavy cream. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, whisking occasionally.
2. Once simmering, whisk constantly for about 30 seconds to dissolve the sugar. Remove from the heat and whisk in the vanilla.
3. Let the glaze cool for about 10 minutes to thicken, whisking occasionally. (When whisking, “valleys” should open up that show the bottom of the pan, indicating it is cool enough. Test a section of the cake- drizzle a spoonful on the top of the cake and let it run down the sides. If it’s moving down slowly, the glaze is ready. If not, give it another minute to cool whisk again). Drizzle the glaze over the cake and let cool until set, about 20 minutes.

#### Notes:
* **Mix the cake by hand** Use a rubber spatula to mix the wet ingredients and dry ingredients together, and then gently fold in the apples and walnuts. No electric mixer is needed for this recipe! Mixing by hand will result in a tender cake and will protect the fruit and nuts from bruising and breaking.
* **Grease the pan well** Want to know the secret to easily removing a bundt cake from the pan? There are two! Start by greasing your pan well. You may even want to use a pastry brush or paper towel to spread the non-stick spray and ensure every pan nook is coated. Second, invert the cake onto a wire cooling rack at the 15-minute mark. This allows the cake to slightly cool and firm up, but the cake will still be warm and will slide out of the greased pan with ease!
* **Whisk the glaze again just before using** Give the glaze an additional quick whisk just before you drizzle it on the cake. This will ensure the ingredients are fully incorporated, and the glaze will have a uniform consistency for the photo-worthy drippy appearance.
