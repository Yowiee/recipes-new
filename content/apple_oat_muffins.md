## Ingredients

- 220g wholemeal flour
- 45g cup rolled oats
- 100g cup brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon cloves
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil
- 2 eggs
- 2 tablespoons golden syrup
- 1 cup applesauce, unsweetened
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 tablespoon fresh grated ginger or 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 large apple, unpeeled and diced-equaling 1 cup (not grated)
- 1 cup walnuts, toasted and chopped (optional)

#### Crumble Top (optional)
- 20g oats
- 30g flour
- 50g brown sugar
- 40g butter, unsalted
- pinch of salt
- pinch of cinnamon

## Directions

1. Heat the oven to 200°C (180°C fan), and grease a 12-hole muffin tray.
2. Mix the crumble topping– to a small bowl add oats, flour, sugar, butter, pinch of salt and cinnamon. Use a fork to mix until it is mixed well and crumbles form. 
3. Mix dry ingredients- In a large mixing bowl stir together flour, oats, sugar, cinnamon, cloves, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. 
4. Whisk wet ingredients- In a medium bowl whisk together oil, eggs, molasses, applesauce, vanilla, and ginger. Add diced apples and walnuts. 
5. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry flour mixture. Fold the batter gently, mix until just combined. Avoid overmixing.
6. Scoop into a greased (butter or oil) muffin tin or use muffin liners. For a standard muffin tin fill each tin a 1/2 inch from the top. Top each muffin with a few teaspoons of crumble.
7. Bake at 200°C (180°C fan) for 5 minutes, decrease to 180°C (160°C fan) and bake 12-13 minutes until puffed and golden. An internal thermometer should register 205F when they are done. You can also test with a toothpick.
