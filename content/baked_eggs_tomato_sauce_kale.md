## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 large bunch kale, chopped
- ½ teaspoon salt, divided
- ¼ teaspoon ground pepper, divided
- 700g jar pasta sauce 
- 8 large eggs

## Directions

1. Heat oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add kale, season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper, and sauté for 2 minutes. Stir in pasta sauce and bring to a simmer.
2. Make 8 wells in the sauce with the back of a spoon and carefully crack an egg into each well. Season the eggs with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper.
3. Cover with lid and cook until the egg whites are set and the yolks are still soft, about 10 minutes.
