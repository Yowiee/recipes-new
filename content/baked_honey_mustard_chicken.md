## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 8 chicken thighs (skin on)
- 1/4 cup honey
- 1/4 cup seeded mustard
- 1 tbsp Dijon mustard
- 1/2 cup sour cream
- 1/2 cup chicken stock
- 1/2 tsp sweet paprika
- 1 clove garlic, crushed
- 3 sprigs thyme

## Directions

1. Heat oil in a large frypan over medium heat. Season chicken pieces with salt and pepper and brown well on all sides. Place in a casserole dish in a single layer.
2. Whisk together remaining ingredients in a jug and pour over chicken. Bake for 30 minutes, basting every 10 minutes, until chicken is cooked through and sauce has reduced and thickened slightly.
