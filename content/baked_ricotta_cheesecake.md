## Ingredients

- Canola oil cooking spray
- 400g fresh ricotta, crumbled
- 250g cream cheese, chopped, softened
- 1/2 cup caster sugar
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 egg
- 2 tbsp Coles Soft Icing Mixture
- 1/2 tsp Coles Cinnamon Ground

#### Pastry
- 1 1/4 cups self-raising flour
- 1/3 cup Coles Cornflour
- 1/3 cup caster sugar
- 100g butter, chilled, chopped
- 1 egg (cold)
- 1 tbsp milk

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 160°C/140°C fan-forced. Place a baking tray in oven. Release the base from a 20cm (base) springform pan and turn over. Place baking paper over base, allowing a 5cm overhang. Secure the base, paper side-up, back in pan. Spray side of pan with canola oil spray
2. Make pastry: Place flour, cornflour, sugar and butter in a food processor. Process until mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add egg and milk. Process until mixture just comes together. Remove 1/3 of dough. Wrap in baking paper. Refrigerate. Roll remaining dough out between 2 sheets of baking paper until 5mm-thick (about 30cm round). Remove top layer of baking paper. Carefully place baking paper, dough-side down into pan. Peel off baking paper. Press dough into pan. Refrigerate.
3. Using an electric mixer, beat ricotta, cream cheese, sugar and vanilla until smooth. Add egg. Beat until combined. Spoon mixture into prepared pan. Roll remaining dough out between 2 sheets of baking paper until 5mm-thick (about 25cm round). Remove top layer of baking paper. Carefully place baking paper, dough-side down onto filling in pan. Peel off baking paper. Trim dough and press edges together to seal.  Cut a small X in the top to allow the steam to escape. Place pan on hot baking tray in oven. Bake for 50 minutes or until golden. Turn off oven. Cool cheesecake in oven for 4 hours with door ajar. Refrigerate overnight. Carefully run a palette knife or butter knife around cheesecake to help release from pan. Dust cheesecake with icing sugar and cinnamon. Serve.
