## Ingredients

- 400g extra-firm tofu, drained, cubed (2 cm) and patted dry
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon salt, divided
- 1/4 teaspoon ground pepper
- 5 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
- 2 teaspoons spicy brown mustard
- 1 teaspoon brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
- 1 shallot, thinly sliced

## Directions

1. Position rack in upper third of oven; preheat grill to High. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with foil.
2. Toss tofu, oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt and pepper together in a medium bowl. Arrange in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Grill until lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Return the tofu to the medium bowl.
3. Meanwhile, whisk vinegar, mustard, brown sugar and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small saucepan; bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, stirring often, until thickened and syrupy, about 5 minutes. Whisk in butter until melted; remove from heat. Add the sauce to the tofu; toss until evenly coated.
4. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the tofu pieces to the same baking sheet. Broil until nicely browned, 3 to 5 minutes more. Use tongs to transfer to a platter, leaving any burned sauce behind. Drizzle with the excess sauce from the bowl, then sprinkle with basil and shallot.
