## Ingredients

- 250g very ripe bananas, peeled and mashed
- 100ml buttermilk
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 1 tbsp neutral oil (I use sunflower)
- 280g plain flour
- 60g caster sugar, plus extra to top
- 50g light brown sugar
- ¼ tsp ground nutmeg
- ½ tsp ground cinnamon
- 1 tsp baking powder
- ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
- 100g salted butter, melted

## Directions

1.Heat the oven to 170°C (150°C fan), and line a six-hole muffin tray with paper liners.
2. Put the bananas and buttermilk in a bowl, mix to combine, then stir in the beaten egg and oil.
3. In a separate bowl, mix the flour, sugars, spices, baking powder and bicarb. Make a well in the centre and pour in the banana mixture, followed by the melted butter.
4. Stir briefly to combine, being careful not to overmix. The batter will be quite thick.
5. Divide the batter evenly between the muffin holes and bake for 23-26 minutes, until the muffins are well risen and golden. Leave to cool completely before serving.
