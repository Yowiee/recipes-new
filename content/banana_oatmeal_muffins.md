## Ingredients

#### Wet Ingredients
- 3 large ripe bananas about 1½ cup / 350 g mashed
- 1 large egg
- 125 g Greek yogurt sub regular yogurt or non-dairy yogurt
- 60 g honey or maple syrup
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

#### Dry Ingredients
- 170 g rolled oats
- 150 g all-purpose flour or whole wheat flour
- 8 g baking powder
- 3 g baking soda
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1 pinch salt

## Directions

1. Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 190°C (170°C fan).  Line a 12-well muffin tin with muffin liners or grease with butter or non-stick spray.
2. In a large bowl, mash bananas until smooth. Add egg, yogurt, honey, and vanilla extract. Whisk until creamy and well combined.
3. Add the all dry ingredients Stir gently until just combined — don’t overmix.
4. Spoon the batter into 12 lined muffin cups. Bake for 20–25 minutes, until golden and a toothpick comes out clean.
5. Let the muffins rest in the pan for 5 minutes, then move them to a rack to cool completely. Once cool, they’ll peel easily from the liners and taste even better.

#### Note:
- For extra flavor, mix in about ½ cup chocolate chips, walnuts, or blueberries.
