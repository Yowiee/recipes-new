## Ingredients

- 1 kg skinless boneless chicken thighs, cut into bite-size pieces
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 4 tablespoons Sriracha chile sauce, divided
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce, divided
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped garlic, divided
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 3 tablespoons neutral oil, such as canola
- 1 cup uncooked white jasmine rice
- 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sweet chili sauce, divided
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar, divided
- 2 cups chicken broth
- 1 cup mayonnaise
- 1/2 cup thinly sliced green (spring) onions
- sesame seeds

## Directions

1. Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 190°C (180°C fan). 
2. Toss together chicken, onion powder, 2 tablespoons Sriracha, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, and 1 tablespoon garlic until well combined in a large bowl. Sprinkle with flour until completely coated. 
3. Heat oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in 2 batches, add chicken in an even layer; cook, undisturbed, until browned on both sides, about 6 minutes total, flipping halfway through. Transfer chicken to a plate. Do not wipe skillet clean. Repeat with remaining chicken. 
4. Reduce heat to medium and stir in rice, 2 tablespoons sweet chili sauce, 1 1/2 teaspoons rice vinegar, remaining 1 tablespoon soy sauce, and remaining 1 tablespoon garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and rice is toasted, about 2 minutes.
5. Stir in broth and bring to a boil over medium-high. Remove from heat and top evenly with chicken. Cover with a tight-fitting lid or aluminum foil.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until rice is tender and cooked through, 22 to 25 minutes.
7. Meanwhile, whisk together mayonnaise, remaining 1/4 cup sweet chili sauce, 2 tablespoons Sriracha, and 1 1/2 teaspoons rice vinegar until smooth. Transfer to a squeeze bottle, or transfer to a resealable plastic bag, reseal the bag, and cut off a small corner.
8. Drizzle casserole with bang bang sauce as desired. Garnish with spring onions and sesame seeds.
