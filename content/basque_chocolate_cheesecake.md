## Ingredients

- 200g semi-sweet chocolate (70% cocoa), chopped
- 200g heavy cream
- 800g cream cheese (full fat)
- 200g sugar
- 6 large eggs
- 20g cornstarch, sifted
- 10g cocoa powder, sifted

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 220°C. Line an 8 inches (20cm) baking tin with baking parchment and grease lightly. The baking parchment should overlap the sides quite a bit so the cheesecake can rise. Set aside.
2. Chop the chocolate and add it together with the heavy cream to a microwave-safe bowl. Slowly melt the chocolate in the microwave and mix to get a thick smooth chocolate sauce (ganache). Let cool down a bit.
3. Add the cream cheese and sugar to a large bowl and mix to combine. Add the eggs one after another to the bowl and mix each time until well combined. Mix cornstarch and cocoa powder and sift into the bowl – mix until well combined. Add the cooled ganache and mix until well combined. 
4. Pour the mixture into the prepared baking tin and bake for about 45-50 minutes in the preheated oven. The sides of the cheesecake should have set but the center should still wiggle if you move the tin. Take out of the oven and let cool down completely, then remove from the tin.
