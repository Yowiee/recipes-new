## Ingredients

- 750 g Cream cheese, room temperature
- 200g Dark chocolate, 65-70%
- 100 g sugar
- 1 tbsp (7 g) Cocoa powder
- 1 tbsp (20 g) plain flour
- 1 tsp Instant coffee
- 5 Large eggs, room temperature
- 300ml Thickened/Heavy cream

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 220°C (200°C fan).  Press 2 x 40cm/16" sheets of scrunched up baking/parchment paper arranged in an "X" into a 20cm/8" springform pan (6cm / 2.5" tall), and fold down over the rim to hold in place.
2. Chop the chocolate and add it together with the heavy cream to a microwave-safe bowl. Slowly melt the chocolate in the microwave and mix to get a thick smooth chocolate sauce (ganache). Let cool down a bit.
3. Place the cream cheese in a large bowl and beat until smooth
4. Add the sugar and mix until well combined
5. Add the flour, cocoa powder, and instant coffee and beat until smooth and lump-free
6. Whisk in the eggs one at a time, then add the chocolate ganache and whisk until smooth
7. Pour into the lined cake tin and bake for 45 mins or until the top starts to darken.  It can take up to 65 minutes and that's fine! Keep a close eye on it for the last 15 minutes, you want it deeply brown but not burnt. The centre will still be wobbly and the cake will rise like a soufflé.
8. Cool in the cake pan for at least 2 hours on the counter (it will sink, that's normal). Then refrigerate for a minimum of 8 hours, uncovered.
9. Release the sides of the springform pan. Hold excess paper overhang to lift off base onto a cutting board or plate. Fold down sides – I love serving it on the paper, it's part of the visuals! Bring to room temp for 30 minutes if time permits, though also great served chilled. Cut like cake! Eat as is – doesn't need cream, berries etc.
