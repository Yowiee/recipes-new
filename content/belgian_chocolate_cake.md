## Ingredients

- 100g Belgian milk chocolate
- 225g self-raising flour
- 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
- 25g cocoa powder
- 125ml sunflower oil
- 125g light soft brown sugar
- 2 medium eggs, at room temperature

#### For the filling and decoration
- 150g Belgian dark chocolate (minimum 70 per cent cocoa solids)
- 50ml milk
- 125ml double cream
- 2-3 tbsp raspberry jam
- 150g mixed summer fruit (strawberries, raspberries and blueberries)

## Directions

1. Break 100g Belgian milk chocolate into pieces and melt slowly in a heat-proof bowl set over a pan of just-simmering water, making sure the base of the bowl doesnâ€™t touch the water. Once melted, set aside to cool for 10 minutes. 
2. Preheat the oven to 180C (160C fan). Grease and line two 20cm round cake tins with greaseproof paper. 
3. Sift 225g self-raising flour, 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda and 25g cocoa powder into a large bowl and make a well in the middle. Stir 125ml sunflower oil, 75ml water and 125g light soft brown sugar into the melted chocolate, then whisk in 2 medium eggs. Pour half the mixture into the well and fold in, then mix in the remaining chocolate mixture. 
4. Divide the mixture evenly between the tins and bake for 20-25 minutes until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Remove the cakes from the tins and cool on a wire rack. 
5. Make a chocolate ganache icing by melting 150g Belgian dark chocolate in a heat-proof bowl, as before. Stir in 50ml milk then set aside to cool. 
6. Whip 125ml double cream in a separate bowl until thick and moussey. Use a large metal spoon to fold in one large spoonful of the cream to the chocolate mixture. Continue to gently fold in the remaining cream until smooth. 
7. Put one cake half on a cake stand and cover the top with 2-3 tbsp raspberry jam. Place the other cake half on top. Spoon about half the ganache on top of the cake and slowly start to work it down the sides to cover the cake, adding spoonfuls of ganache to the sides until it is all covered. Put the remaining ganache on top and swirl into a pleasing pattern. Pile 150g mixed summer fruit into the middle of the cake, slice and serve.
