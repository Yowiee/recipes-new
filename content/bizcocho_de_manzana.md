## Ingredients

#### Apple cake
- 2 cups of cake flour 180 g
- 1/4 teaspoon of salt
- 2 teaspoons of baking powder
- 1 cup of granulated sugar 150 g
- Pinch of ground cinnamon
- 3 large eggs
- 1 cup Greek yogurt 220 ml
- 2/3 cup of Spanish extra virgin olive oil 160 ml
- 1 large apple peeled and diced into small chunks

#### Apple Crumble Topping
- 1/8 cup butter 30 g at room temperature (For a healthier option, sub for extra virgin olive oil)
- 1/4 cup brown sugar 90 g
- 1/4 cup flour 30 g
- 1 Tablespoon cinnamon
- 1 Apple peeled and thinly sliced

## Directions

#### Prepare cake batter
1. Preheat your oven to 180°C and lightly grease a 10-inch (25 cm) cake pan.
2. In a medium-sized bowl mix together the salt and baking powder. Use a flour sieve to add the flour and mix well.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk the sugar, and eggs for 4 minutes. (if using a hand mixer, be sure to use the low setting).
4. Next, gently fold in the Greek yogurt and once combined evenly, slowly add the olive oil while mixing constantly.
5. Fold in the flour mixture using a spatula, add the apple chunks and a pinch of ground cinnamon then gently fold in until all ingredients are combined.
6. Pour the cake batter into the greased and floured cake pan.

#### Apple Crumble Topping
7. Mix together the flour, cinnamon, and sugar in a small bowl.
8. Add the butter and mash together with the back of a fork. Aim to make tiny crumbs without too many clumps.
9. Apply a thin layer of apple slices, don’t worry if they sink slightly into the cake batter. Cover the apple slices with the crumble mixture.

#### Bake, rest, and serve
10. Bake for about 50 minutes in a preheated 180°C oven (or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out with only a few crumbs).
11. Take your cake out of the oven and let cool for at least 20 minutes before removing from the cake pan. To serve, add a light dusting of icing sugar (around 1 tablespoon is plenty)
