## Ingredients

- 5¼ cups (785g) self-raising (self-rising) flour
- 1½ cup (330g) caster (superfine) sugar
- 3 eggs
- 1 cup (250ml) light-flavoured extra virgin olive oil
- ½ cup (125ml) milk
- 3 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 3 cups (375g) frozen blueberries

#### CHEESECAKE FILLING
- 125g cream cheese, chopped and softened
- 1½ tablespoons caster (superfine) sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 180°C. Line a 12 x ½ cup (125ml) capacity muffin tin with paper muffin cases. 
2. To make the cheesecake filling, place the cream cheese, sugar and vanilla in a bowl and mix until smooth. Set aside.
3. Place the flour and sugar in a bowl and mix to combine. Make a well in the centre. Add the eggs, oil, milk and vanilla and mix until just combined. Add the blueberries and fold through.
4. Spoon mixture into prepared tins until each hole is about half full. Add a spoonful of the cheesecake mixture in the centre of each and top with remaining muffin mixture.
5. Bake for 30–35 minutes or until firm to touch. Allow to cool for 5 minutes and serve warm

#### Notes:
- If making regular muffins, reduce baking time to 20 mins
- To make the paper muffin cases, cut 20 cm x 20 cm square pieces of Glad to be Green® Compostable Bake Paper. Gently fold each square in half, pinching the centre to make a small crease. Repeat on the other side to form a small cross in the centre of the square. Using a tall glass, upside-down, place each piece of paper over the bottom of the glass, making sure the small cross is in the centre of the glass. Firmly press down to create the muffin paper casing.
