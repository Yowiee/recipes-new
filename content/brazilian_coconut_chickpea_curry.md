## Ingredients

#### Chickpea Curry:
- 1.5 tbsp olive oil
- 1 onion , finely chopped
- 2 garlic cloves , minced
- 1 red capsicum/bell peppers , cut into 3 x 0.75cm / 1.25 x 1/3"" strips
- 2 cans chickpeas , drained (Note 1)
- 400ml/14oz coconut milk , full fat for best flavour (Note 2)
- 400ml/14oz can crushed tomato
- 1 cup (250ml) chicken or vegetable stock/broth , low sodium
- 1 tbsp paprika
- 1 tbsp cumin
- 1/2 - 1 tsp cayenne pepper (adjust spiciness to taste)
- 1.5 tsp sugar (any type)
- 0.5 tsp salt
- 50g / 2oz baby spinach leaves (or kale)

#### Finishing & Serving:
- 3 tbsp coriander/cilantro , roughly chopped, plus more for serving (Note 3)
- 1 tbsp lime juice , plus extra wedges for serving
- Yogurt (optional)
- Rice - or something to soak up the sauce (Note 4)

## Directions

1. Heat oil in a pot or large deep skillet over high heat. Add garlic and onion, cook for 1 minute.
2. Add capsicum, cook for 2 minutes until onion is translucent and slightly golden on edges.
3. Add remaining Curry ingredients except baby spinach. Stir, bring to simmer then lower to medium low so it's simmering gently.
4. Simmer 12 - 15 minutes until it changes from pale pink to an orangey red colour.
5. Stir in spinach until just wilted, then stir in coriander and lime juice. Add more salt it needed.
6. Serve over rice with a dollop of yogurt, extra sprinkle of coriander and squeeze of lime (don't go overboard, I often do and it's too sour!)

#### Notes
1. Chickpeas - can use any canned beans, I've made this often with black beans, cannelloni beans and even lentils!
Dried chickpeas - Note 5 below.
2. Coconut milk - full fat best for flavour because the fat is where the flavour is. But light is ok too.
3. Coriander haters - sub with chives! Still tasty but will be missing the coriander flavour which is in traditional Brazilian Fish Stew.
4. Serve over something to soak up the sauce. Plain white rice, lime rice, cauliflower rice, mashed potato, couscous, polenta or even pasta.
