## Ingredients

#### FOR THE BROWNIE BATTER
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter melted (113g)
- ¾ cup semisweet chocolate chips or roughly chopped chocolate
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar (100g)
- 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar (100g)
- ⅓ cup cocoa powder (35g)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (5ml)
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 large eggs
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour (65g)

#### FOR THE COOKIE DOUGH
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter room temperature (113g)
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar (100g)
- 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar (50g)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 large egg
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour (160g)
- 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 170°C. Line a 9x13 baking dish with parchment or foil.
2. For the brownies melt butter then stir in cocoa powder. Whisk in both sugar and the salt then add the eggs and vanilla and beat well (secret to glossy brownies is to beat the eggs and sugar very well.)
3. Add the flour and mix until almost combined then fold in the chocolate chips and finish the batter off by hand with a spatula scraping the bowl down and mixing in any errant flour etc.
4. Transfer the brownie batter to your prepared pan and spread into a thin layer then set aside.
5. For the cookie dough
6. Cream the butter, and sugars on high for 3-4 minutes or until light and fluffy, scraping the bowl down as needed.
7. Mix in the vanilla and egg and scrape the bowl down once more.
8. Add salt baking soda and powder then mix until combined.
9. Pour in the flour and mix until almost combined then fold in the chocolate chips, reserving a handful to sprinkle on top later. Finish mixing the batter with your spatula then drop spoonfuls onto the brownie batter. You don't need full coverage, it will be nice to see the brownie batter peaking through after baking.
10. Cover with foil and bake at 170°C for 20 min then bake another 20 min uncovered. Allow to cool before removing from pan and cutting.

#### Notes
- You can melt the chocolate chips for the brownie batter and stir in after adding the cocoa if you want that fudgy texture throughout.
- The secret to glossy brownies is to beat the eggs and sugar very well.
- You can add in grated orange zest, mini marshmallows, sprinkles, or different flavored extracts for different variations.
- Try adding ¾ cup of toasted, chopped walnuts or pecans to the batter for added crunch and flavor.
