## Ingredients

#### Base
- 200g almond meal
- 90ml maple syrup
- 50g butter, melted
- 40g toasted sesame seeds
- 1 tsp vanilla essence
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp ground ginger

#### Filling
- 100g butter
- 1kg apples, cored and peeled
- 1 tsp apple cider vinegar
- 1/4 cup maple syrup, divided
- 1 cup almond meal
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp vanilla essence

#### Topping
- 150g good-quality white chocolate
- 1 tsp tahini (sesame seed paste)
- 2 tsp toasted sesame seeds

## Directions

1. To make the base, stir combine all ingredients in a large bowl until a dough-like consistency. Press evenly into the base of a baking paper lined slice tin and chill while you make the filling.
2. To make the filling, melt butter over medium heat until bubbling. Cook, swirling around occasionally, for 2 minutes until it starts to smell nutty. Add apples, apple cider vinegar and half the maple syrup. Cook over medium heat for 30-35 minutes, stirring frequently, until deeply golden, soft and developing a nice char.
3. Reduce heat to low and break up the apples with a fork until a smooth mash. You can alternatively blend in a food processor.
4. Transfer to a bowl and stir through almond meal, salt, vanilla and the remaining maple syrup. Spread over your prepared base and smooth the top. Chill while you make the topping.
5. To make the topping, gently melt white chocolate chips in the microwave in 15 second bursts. Stir through tahini. Slowly add hot water, 1 tsp at a time, until the mixture can be drizzled â€“ you should only need 3-4 tsp of water.
6. Drizzle over the apple filling and smooth the top. Evenly sprinkle with sesame seeds and chill for 6 hours or overnight, until set. Cut into 6 big or 8 medium slabs. Serve chilled or at room temperature.
