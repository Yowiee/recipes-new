## Ingredients

#### Cake
- 50g dried apricots, chopped
- 40g sultanas
- 2 tbsp whiskey
- 250g almond meal
- 50g cornflour
- 4 tsp cinnamon
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp ginger
- 1/2 tsp ground cardamom
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 75g butter, soft
- 1 1/2 cups maple syrup
- 2 eggs
- Juice and zest of half a lemon
- 150g carrot, grated
- 75g canned pineapple, drained and chopped
- 50g roasted walnuts, chopped

#### Icing
- 200g cream cheese
- 100g butter, at room temperature, diced
- 100g icing sugar
- 1/2 tsp whiskey
- 1/4 tsp salt

## Directions

1. Place apricots and sultanas in a small bowl and pour over whiskey. Leave to soak for at least 30 minutes.
2.  Preheat oven to 180°C fan forced. Line a 20cm springform cake tin with baking paper.
3.  Add almond meal, cornflour, baking powder, ginger and salt to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Briefly mix to combine.
4.  Add butter and mix on low for 30 seconds, until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs, then add maple syrup and beat on low to incorporate. Increase speed to medium and beat for 30 seconds.
5.  Add eggs and lemon juice, and beat on medium to incorporate. Finally, increase speed to medium-high and beat for 45 seconds. The mixture should be thick and creamy.
6.  Add the lemon zest, soaked fruit (and the whiskey), walnuts, grated carrot and pineapple and fold through. Transfer batter to your cake tin and smooth the top.
7.  Bake for 50-55 minutes, until nicely browned and a skewer inserted comes out clean. When cooked, allow to cool in the tin for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack and cooling completely.
8.  Meanwhile, making the icing. Clean out your mixing bowl and paddle. Place the cream cheese and butter in the bowl and beat, using the paddle attachment, for 3-4 minutes on medium until creamy.
9.  Reduce speed to low and gradually add icing sugar. Once incorporated, add whiskey and salt, and briefly beat through. Refrigerate until ready to ice.
10. When the cake has completely cooled, dollop over the icing and spread to the edges. Garnish with crushed roasted walnuts, and serve at room temperature.
