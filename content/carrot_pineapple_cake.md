## Ingredients

#### Cake:

- 2 1/2 cups (315g) all-purpose flour
- 2 tsp. baking powder
- 1 tsp. baking soda
- 1 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp. kosher salt
- 1/2 tsp. ground ginger
- 1/4 tsp. ground nutmeg, plus more for garnish
- 1 1/4 cups (250g) packed light brown sugar
- 1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil or canola oil
- 1 tsp. vanilla extract
- 4 large eggs, at room temperature
- 1 can crushed pineapple, drained 
- 2 cups shredded carrots (from 2 medium [4 oz. each] carrots)
- 3/4 cup chopped toasted walnuts, plus more for garnish

#### Cream Cheese Frosting:

- 8 oz. cream cheese, softened
- 1/2 cup (4 oz.) unsalted butter, softened
- 4 cups (about 13 oz.) powdered sugar, sifted
- 1 tsp. vanilla extract
- 1/4 tsp. kosher salt

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 170Â°C. Coat a 30x20 cm baking dish with baking spray. 
2. Whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, ginger, and nutmeg in a large bowl until combined.
3. Whisk together brown sugar, granulated sugar, oil, vanilla, eggs, and pineapple in a separate medium bowl until combined. Using a silicone spatula, gently fold sugar mixture into flour mixture until just combined, about 2 minutes, being careful not to overmix.
4. Fold carrots and walnuts into bowl until evenly incorporated. Spread batter evenly into prepared baking dish.
5. Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into center of cake comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Remove cake from oven, and let cool completely in baking dish on a wire rack, about 2 hours.
6. In a large bowl, beat cream cheese and butter with an electric mixer on medium speed until combined and creamy, about 3 minutes. 
7. Reduce mixer speed to low; gradually add powdered sugar, vanilla, and salt, beating until combined, about 1 minute, stopping to scrape down sides of bowl as needed. Increase mixer speed to high, and beat until smooth, about 1 minute.
8. Spread Cream Cheese Frosting evenly over cooled Cake. Garnish with additional walnuts and nutmeg.
