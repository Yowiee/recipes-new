## Ingredients

- 1 large cauliflower cut into florets (about 6 cups or 700 g)
- 1 can chickpeas 15 oz or 400 g drained and rinsed
- 3 medium red onions sliced

#### Shawarma Mix
- 4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 3 cloves garlic grated
- 3 teaspoons paprika sweet or smoked
- 2 teaspoons ground coriander
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 0.5 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon salt + black pepper and red pepper flakes to taste

#### Serves Well With
- 185 g cooked quinoa sub rice or any grain of your choice
- 1 cucumber + tomato (diced)
- 0.25 cup chopped parsley + lemon wedges
- 125 g Greek yogurt or ⅓ cup tahini -> whisked with 2 Tbsp lemon juice, 6 Tbsp water, and a pinch of salt

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 220°C (200°C fan). 
2. Mix all shawarma ingredients together in a large bowl. Add vegetables and toss well to coat.
3. Spread everything out in a single layer and roast for 25 to 30 minutes or until golden and lightly charred on the edges.
4. Make the serving sauce: Whisk 125 g Greek yogurt or tahini, lemon juice, and salt in a small bowl. Add cold water, a tablespoon at a time, until the sauce becomes creamy and pourable. Set aside.
5. Assemble the bowls: Add 185 g cooked quinoa, 0.25 cup chopped parsley, and a squeeze of lemon directly to the sheet pan. Toss with the roasted vegetables so the quinoa picks up all the pan flavors.
6. Spoon into bowls and top with diced cucumber and tomato. Drizzle generously with the sauce and enjoy.
