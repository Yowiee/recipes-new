## Ingredients

#### BBQ Tahini Ranch Dressing
- ⅓ cup tahini
- 3 tablespoons barbecue sauce
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
- ⅓ cup cold water
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- ½ teaspoon Tamari
- sea salt and ground black pepper, to taste

#### Corn Quinoa Salad
- ¾ cup quinoa, rinsed
- 1 ⅓ cups water
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 1 can corn kernels, drained
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 small red onion, small dice
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1 ½ cups cooked black beans, drained and rinsed
- ½ cup chopped cilantro
- 1 large ripe avocado, peeled and diced
- 3 tablespoons toasted and salted pumpkin seeds

## Directions

1. Make the dressing. In a medium bowl, whisk together the tahini, barbecue sauce, apple cider vinegar, water, garlic powder, onion powder, Tamari, salt, and pepper. Once you have a creamy and lush dressing, you’re good! Set aside.
2. Combine the quinoa, water, and a pinch of salt in a small saucepan. Bring the quinoa to a boil over medium heat and then reduce to a simmer. Simmer until all of the water is absorbed and the little tails from the quinoa are starting to pop out, about 15 minutes. Fluff with a fork and set aside to cool.
3. Set a cast iron skillet over medium heat. Once hot, pour in the olive oil. Add the corn and season with salt, pepper, and the cumin. Sauté until corn is softened and lightly charred, about 6-7 minutes. Set aside to cool.
4. In a large bowl, combine the quinoa, charred corn, red onion, cherry tomatoes, black beans, and cilantro. Season the mixture well with salt and pepper. Drizzle ¾ of the BBQ tahini ranch over the salad and toss. Transfer the salad to your serving platter and Top it with the avocado. Drizzle the salad with the remaining dressing and top with pumpkin seeds. Enjoy!

#### Notes
* Having smooth, pourable tahini is so important! It really helps with achieving that lush saucy texture. I love Soom brand personally. 
* I tested this with several types of barbecue sauces ranging from popular supermarket brands to unsweetened varieties. Just use whichever brand you prefer for everyday use!
