## Ingredients

#### Brownie Layer
- 100 g dark chocolate
- 100 g milk chocolate
- 180 g unsalted butter
- 320 g superfine sugar
- 1 tablespoon instant coffee granules
- 3 eggs extra large
- 125 g cake flour
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 260 g Oreos

#### Cheesecake Layer
- 500 g cream cheese
- 170 g superfine sugar
- 3 eggs extra large
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 140 ml heavy cream
- 80 g Oreos crushed

## Directions

#### Brownie Layer
1. Preheat the oven to 160°C (320°F) and line a rectangular baking tin 35x28x7cm (14x11x3 inches) with oil and parchment paper.
2. Add the chopped butter and both types of chocolate to a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water. Allow the chocolate and butter to melt while stirring occasionally. Once melted, remove from the heat and set aside. 
3. Add the eggs, coffee granules, and sugar to a mixing bowl and stir to combine. Do not beat.
4. Add the slightly cooled chocolate mixture to the egg mixture and mix with a rubber spatula.
5. Sift together the flour and salt, then add this to the brownie mixture and stir to combine.
6. Pour the brownie batter into the prepared baking tin and smooth it over with the back of a spoon to create an even layer. 
7. Place a layer of Oreos on top of the brownie batter.

#### Cheesecake Layer
1. In a bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, add the sugar and the cubed cream cheese. Beat at medium speed until smooth and well combined.
2. With the mixer’s motor running at medium speed, add the eggs to the cream cheese mixture one at a time, ensuring to scrape down the sides of the bowl between each addition.
3. Add the vanilla extract and whipping cream to the cheesecake batter and beat at medium-high speed for about 2 minutes. Pour the cheesecake mixture over the brownie and Oreo layer.
4. Sprinkle a layer of crushed Oreos over the cheesecake layer. 
5. Bake the Oreo Cheesecake Brownies in a preheated oven for 30 minutes or until the cheesecake layer has set and pulled away slightly from the tin. Switch off the oven and allow the brownies to cool in the oven for 2 hours before covering the tray with aluminum foil and refrigerating overnight. 
6. Remove the brownies from the tin and place them onto a serving plate, slice into squares of about 5cm (2 inches) serve with extra crushed Oreos, and enjoy!
