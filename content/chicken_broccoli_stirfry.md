## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth
- 1/3 cup reduced-salt soy sauce
- 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 3 tbsp. honey
- 2 tbsp. cornstarch
- 1 tbsp. finely grated peeled ginger
- 2 tsp. toasted sesame oil
- 1 tbsp. neutral oil
- 1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts, cut into 1/2" pieces 
- 2 medium heads broccoli, cut into bite-sized florets
- Cooked brown or white rice and toasted sesame seeds, for serving

## Directions

1. In a small bowl, whisk broth, soy sauce, garlic, honey, cornstarch, ginger, and sesame oil until cornstarch is dissolved.
2. In a large skillet or wok over high heat, heat neutral oil. Cook chicken, undisturbed, until it easily releases from pan, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown on all sides and just cooked through, about 5 minutes more. Transfer to a plate.
3. In same skillet over medium-low heat, toss broccoli in broth mixture. Cover skillet and let broccoli steam until crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes.
4. Uncover and return chicken and any accumulated juices to skillet. Cook, stirring, until sauce is thickened and chicken and broccoli are well coated, 1 to 2 minutes more.
5. Divide rice among plates or bowls. Spoon stir-fry over. Top with sesame seeds.
