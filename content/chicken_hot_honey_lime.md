## Ingredients

- 1.5kg bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
- Salt and black pepper
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- 2 tablespoons butter (unsalted or salted), melted
- 2 tablespoons hot sauce (see Tip)
- 1 lime
- 2 tablespoons mild honey

## Directions

1. Heat the oven to 220°C. On a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet, season the chicken all over with salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder. Arrange the chicken skin side up then roast until browned, 20 minutes.
2. While the chicken is roasting, combine the melted butter and hot sauce and whisk to combine; transfer half to a separate bowl and set aside for later. After the chicken has roasted for 20 minutes, brush the chicken all over with the remaining butter mixture. Continue roasting until the chicken is golden brown and cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes more. Remove the chicken thighs from the oven.
3. Zest the lime, then cut it in half. Add the honey and 1 teaspoon lime zest to the reserved butter-hot sauce mixture and whisk to combine, then brush over the chicken thighs and squeeze the lime juice on top. Serve immediately.

#### Notes:
1. Different hot sauces have different levels of heat; choose one that suits your heat tolerance. Tabasco will be quite spicy, while a brand like Louisiana will yield a milder result.
