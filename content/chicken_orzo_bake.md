## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided
- 1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano, divided
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed of excess fat
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/2 cup thinly sliced shallot (about 1 large shallot)
- 1 bunch asparagus, woody ends trimmed, cut into 2-inch pieces
- 2 cups halved cherry tomatoes
- 1/2 cup dry white wine
- 3/4 cup orzo (sub gluten-free orzo for gluten-free)
- 400g can quartered artichoke hearts, drained
- 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
- 1/2 cup pitted Kalamata olives
- 1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese (omit for dairy-free)
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 200Â°C.
2. In a small bowl, combine 1 teaspoon of the salt, 1/2 teaspoon of the oregano, the black pepper, paprika, cumin, and cayenne. Pat the chicken dry and season with the spice blend on both sides evenly.
3. In a large deep ovenproof skillet (preferably cast-iron), heat the oil over medium-high heat. Working in batches if necessary, so as not to overcrowd the skillet, add the chicken in a single layer and cook until golden brown on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer the browned chicken to a plate and set aside. The chicken does not have to be cooked through as it will finish in the oven.
4. Reduce the heat beneath the skillet to medium, add the garlic, shallot, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring, until the tomatoes begin to soften and the asparagus turns bright green, about 4 minutes.
5. Pour in the wine and deglaze the skillet, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom. Cook, stirring, until the wine is reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Add the orzo, artichoke hearts, broth, and remaining 1 teaspoon oregano and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a simmer, then nestle the browned chicken into the skillet and sprinkle the olives over the entire skillet.
6. Transfer to the oven and bake, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and crumble the feta (if using) over the chicken. Return to the oven and bake until the chicken is cooked through and the orzo is tender, 10 to 12 more minutes.
7. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving. Garnish with the fresh parsley.
