## Ingredients

- ¼ cup olive oil
- 6 celery stalks, cut into ¼-inch pieces
- 1 large green capcicum, cut into ¼-inch pieces
- 1 medium yellow onion, cut into ¼-inch pieces
- 3 large garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 400g tinned plum tomatoes
- 2 tsp salt
- 1 tsp paprika
- 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
- 1/2 tsp chili powder
- 1 tsp brown sugar
- 6 cups chicken stock (see Tip)
- 1 cup arborio rice
- 400g smoked or rotisserie chicken meat, pulled into large pieces (from roughly half a bird)
- Chopped scallions, for garnish

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 170°C.
2. In a Dutch oven or other large, heavy pot, heat the oil over medium. Add the celery, bell pepper, onion and garlic, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables become translucent and soft, about 10 minutes.
3. Add the stewed tomatoes and spices to the sautéed vegetables and cook, stirring occasionally, until all the liquid is gone and the mixture begins to caramelize on the bottom of the pot, about 10 minutes.
4. Add the stock and bring to a boil, raising the heat if needed. Stir in the rice and chicken and transfer to the oven.
5. Bake, uncovered, until the rice is soft and cooked through, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven, season with salt to taste and garnish with the scallions.
