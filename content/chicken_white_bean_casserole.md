## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 1 cup finely chopped yellow onion
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic
- 1 (280g) package frozen spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
- 4 ounces reduced-fat cream cheese, cut into cubes and softened
- 1 (420g) can no-salt-added white beans, rinsed
- 3 cups chopped cooked chicken
- 180g crumbled feta cheese
- 80g finely grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 ½ tablespoons chopped fresh dill
- ½ teaspoon grated lemon zest
- ½ teaspoon ground pepper
- 6 frozen phyllo pastry sheets, thawed in refrigerator overnight

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 200°F. Lightly coat an 8-inch-square baking dish with cooking spray.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add garlic; cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in spinach and cream cheese; cook, stirring constantly, until the cream cheese is melted and the vegetables are coated, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl and let cool slightly, about 5 minutes.
3. Add beans, chicken, feta, Parmesan, dill, lemon zest and pepper to the spinach mixture; stir until fully combined. Spoon into the prepared baking dish.
4. Cut each phyllo sheet in half crosswise. Place 1 half sheet on top of the spinach mixture; brush with some of the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Repeat the process with the remaining phyllo sheets and oil, stacking the sheets. Score the phyllo into 2-inch squares with a sharp knife. Bake until golden brown on top, about 25 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.
