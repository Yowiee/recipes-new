## Ingredients

- 195 grams almond flour
- 224 grams granulated sugar, plus more for rolling
- 3 tablespoons unsweetened Dutch-processed cocoa powder
- Pinch of salt
- 3 large egg whites
- ½ teaspoon almond extract
- Powdered sugar, for rolling
- Blanched almonds (optional)


## Directions

1. Heat oven to 160°C (140°C fan). Line two baking sheets with parchment.
2. Stir together almond flour, granulated sugar, cocoa and salt in a large mixing bowl.
3. In a small bowl, put egg whites and almond extract. Beat with a fork until frothy.
4. Add egg white mixture to almond flour mixture, and stir well with a large spoon or spatula to form a sticky dough.
5. Use a teaspoon to scoop a walnut-sized blob of dough. Gently roll between palms into a 1-inch round. Toss lightly in a bowl of granulated sugar, then generously in a bowl of powdered sugar to coat well. Repeat with the rest of the dough. Place on parchment paper 2 inches apart; there should be 12 cookies per sheet. Push a blanched almond in the center of each cookie.
6. Bake on the center rack until a thin crust has formed and the surface is crinkly, 15 to 20 minutes. Do not overbake — the goal is a chewy center. Repeat with the rest of the dough until all of the cookies are baked. Let cool, and serve.
