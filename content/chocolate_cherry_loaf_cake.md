## Ingredients

#### Cake
- 2 large eggs
- 200g caster sugar
- 110g vegetable oil
- 80g full cream milk
- 100g sour cream
- 1.5 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 150g self-raising flour
- 45g unsweetened cocoa powder
- Pinch of salt
- 150g milk chocolate chips
- Cherry jam, about half a 375g jar for the cake and icing (see tips above)

#### Sour cream icing (optional)
- 100g butter, at room temperature
- 55g sour cream, at room temperature
- 250g icing sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla essence

## Directions

1. Preheat your oven to 180Â°C. Grease and line a standard loaf pan (34cm x 13cm) with baking paper.
2. Add the eggs, sugar, oil, milk, sour cream and vanilla extract to a large bowl and whisk until smooth. A few clumps of sour cream are fine.
3. Add the flour, cocoa powder and salt and stir through with your whisk until just combined. Do not over mix!
4. Reserve a handful of chocolate chips for the top of your cake. In a small bowl, toss the remaining chocolate chips with a teaspoon of flour to coat. This stops them from sinking to the bottom of your cake. Slowly stir the chocolate chips through the mixture with your whisk, about two or three times to combine.
5. Pour the mixture into your pan. Place heaped teaspoons of cherry jam over the top of the mixture and swirl through with the back of a spoon. Scatter the remaining chocolate chips on top and bake for 40 minutes or until a toothpick comes out with a few moist crumbs. Let the cake cool in the pan for 20 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
6. To make your icing, beat the sour cream, butter and icing sugar with an electric mixer until smooth. See tips above if you're using a bowl and whisk. Slather a thick layer of icing on your completely cooled cake. Place dollops of cherry jam on top of the icing and swirl through. Serve and enjoy!

#### Notes:
* Use as little or as much jam as you'd like in the cake, keeping in mind that the more you use, the sweeter your cake will be. I use half a jar of jam between the cake and icing.
* Depending on the temperature of your oven, you may need to bake for longer. To make sure your cake retains its moistness, you're looking for a toothpick to come out with a few crumbs, not clean.
