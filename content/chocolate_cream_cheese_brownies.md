## Ingredients

- 200g good-quality dark chocolate, chopped
- 200g unsalted butter, softened
- 1 1/4 cups brown sugar
- 4 eggs
- 1/2 cup plain flour
- 1/4 cup cocoa powder
- 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 250g cream cheese, softened
- 1/4 cup caster sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla essence

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 180Â°C. Grease a 4cm deep, 16cm x 26cm (base) slab pan. Line with baking paper, allowing a 2cm overhang at both long ends.
2. Place chocolate in a heatproof, microwave-safe bowl. Microwave, uncovered, on MEDIUM (50%) for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring every minute with a metal spoon, or until almost melted. Stir until smooth.
3. Meanwhile, using electric beaters, cream butter and brown sugar until pale. Add 3 eggs, 1 at a time, mixing until well combined (mixture may curdle slightly). Sift flour, cocoa and baking powder over butter mixture and fold in until almost combined. Add melted chocolate and mix well. Transfer to another bowl.
4. Rinse beaters and bowl. Beat cream cheese, caster sugar and vanilla until soft and creamy. Add remaining egg and beat for a further 2 minutes. Spread half the chocolate mixture over base of prepared pan. Using half the cheese mixture, drop heaped teaspoons cheese mixture over the top. Cover with remaining chocolate mixture. Dollop over remaining cheese mixture. Using a flat-bladed knife, swirl mixture to create a rippled effect. Bake for 40 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the centre has moist crumbs clinging. Allow to cool in pan. Use paper to lift out slice. Cut into pieces and serve.
