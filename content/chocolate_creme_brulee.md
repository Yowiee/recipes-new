## Ingredients

- 50g milk chocolate
- 50g dark chocolate
- 400ml double cream
- 100ml milk
- 40g caster sugar, plus extra to caramelise
- ¼ tsp salt, plus extra to finish
- 6 egg yolks


## Directions

1. Heat the oven to 150°C (130°C fan). Finely chop both chocolates and put them in a large bowl.
2. Put the cream, milk, sugar and smoked salt in a small saucepan, and heat gently until the mixture is steaming (ie, to just before a boil). Pour the hot milk over the chocolate, leave it be for 30 seconds, then stir until the chocolate has completely melted. Whisk in the egg yolks, then pour the mixture through a sieve and into a jug.
3. Divide the custard mixture between six ramekins, then put them in a large roasting tin. Boil the kettle, let the water cool for a couple of minutes, then carefully pour enough into the roasting tin to come about halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until there’s just a slight wobble in the middle.
4. Remove the ramekins from their water bath, leave them to cool to room temperature then chill in the fridge for three to four hours, or overnight.
5. When you’re ready to serve, sprinkle an even layer of caster sugar on top of each custard, then caramelise the sugar using a blowtorch (or pop the ramekins under a very hot grill for a minute or two). Top with a little extra smoked salt, then leave the sugar to harden before serving.
