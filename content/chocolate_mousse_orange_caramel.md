## Ingredients

- 360g dark (65%) chocolate, roughly chopped
- 6 eggs, yolks and whites separated
- 60g caster sugar
- 460ml thickened cream
- 100g sour cream
- 50g blanched hazelnuts, toasted and roughly chopped, to serve

#### Orange caramel (optional)
- 100g caster sugar
- 2-3 large oranges: 4 strips of peel cut into thin strips to garnish, then juice to get 1/2 cup (125ml) juice

## Directions

1. Melt the chocolate by placing it in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water, making sure that the base of the bowl is not touching the water. Stir from time to time, until melted, then remove from the heat and set aside to cool slightly; it can be just warm, but not hot.
2. Add the egg yolks to a medium mixing bowl and, using a hand whisk, beat for a minute or so until lightened. Add the cooled melted chocolate and stir gently to combine.
3. Whisk the whites in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on medium-high speed for 2 minutes, until frothy. Slowly stream in the sugar and continue to whisk for 2-3 minutes, until shiny and stiff peaks form. In batches of three, add the whisked egg white mixture to the chocolate mix, folding gently to combine and taking care not to overwork it; it should remain looking streaky.
4. Without washing the mixer bowl, add 360ml of the cream and whisk on medium speed for 3 minutes, until soft peaks form. Keep a close eye here, as it can over-whip. Fold gently but thoroughly into the chocolate mixture, along with 1/2 tsp salt flakes, then scrape the mix into a serving bowl or into eight individual glasses. Refrigerate for 3 hours (or overnight - though itâ€™s fine for up to 3 days), until cold.
5. If making the caramel, place a small saucepan over medium-high heat and sprinkle over half the sugar. Stir to melt, then add the rest of the sugar and cook for about 3 minutes, stirring from time to time, until a deep amber caramel. Remove from the heat and carefully pour in the orange juice (it will splutter quite a bit). Return to the heat, stirring so that any unmelted bits of sugar dissolve. Stir in 1/4 tsp salt flakes and set aside to cool.
6. Put the remaining 100ml thickened cream into a small bowl and add the sour cream. Whisk for about a minute, until starting to thicken.
7. About 15 minutes before serving, remove mousse from the fridge. Dollop over the cream topping, drizzle over some of the caramel, if using, and finish with a sprinkle of hazelnuts and orange peel.
