## Ingredients

#### Whipped Chocolate Ganache
- 1 c. (170 g.) semisweet chocolate chips
- 1 c. heavy cream

#### Cookies
- 10 Oreo cookies
- 2 c. (240 g.) all-purpose flour
- 3 Tbsp. unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 tsp. baking powder
- 1/2 tsp. baking soda
- 1/2 tsp. kosher salt
- 1 c. (2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted, cooled
- 1/2 c. (110 g.) packed brown sugar
- 1/4 c. (50 g.) granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 tsp. pure vanilla extract

#### Whipped Cream & Assembly
- 1/2 c. heavy cream
- 1 Tbsp. confectioners' sugar
- 1/2 tsp. pure vanilla extract
- Pinch of kosher salt

## Directions

1. Place chips in a medium heatproof bowl. In a small pot over medium heat, heat cream until small bubbles begin to form around edges of pan. (Do not bring to a boil.) Pour cream over chips. Let sit 1 minute, then thoroughly whisk until chocolate and cream are combined and smooth.
2. Place plastic wrap over ganache and refrigerate at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour.

#### Cookies
1. Preheat oven to 350º. Separate and scrape filling off Oreos. In a food processor, pulse wafers until finely ground; enjoy filling as a chef's snack.
2. Transfer to a medium bowl. Add flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt and whisk to combine.
3. In a large bowl, using a handheld mixer on medium-high speed, beat butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until well combined. Add eggs, one at a time, beating to blend after each addition. Beat in vanilla.
4. Slowly add dry ingredients, folding with a spatula until just combined. Using a large cookie scoop (about 3 Tbsp.), scoop dough onto 2 parchment-lined baking sheets.
5. Bake cookies until edges are set and centers puff slightly, 12 to 14 minutes.
6. Immediately use a large measuring cup to create a well in center of cookies. Transfer cookies to a wire rack and let cool.

#### Whipped Cream & Assembly
1. In a medium bowl, using handheld mixer on medium-high speed, beat cream, confectioners’ sugar, vanilla, and salt until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes.
2. Transfer ganache to another medium bowl. Using handheld mixer, beat on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 4 to 5 minutes.
3. Top each cookie with about 2 Tbsp. whipped ganache and a dollop of whipped cream.
