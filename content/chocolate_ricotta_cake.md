## Ingredients

- 100 g Dark Chocolate (70 cocoa)
- 175 g Unsalted Butter (melted and cooled slightly)
- 300 g Granulated Sugar
- 164 g All-Purpose Flour
- 45 g Dutch Processed Cocoa Powder
- 2 tsp Baking Powder
- 1 tsp Salt
- 3 Large Eggs
- 365 g Whole Milk Ricotta Cheese
- 3 tsp Vanilla Extract
- ½ cup Mini Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips (optional, but highly recommended, topping)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 170°C. Generously spray the sides and bottom of a 20cm springform pan with a based baking spray. Set to the side.
2. In a medium-sized microwaveable bowl, melt together the unsalted butter and bar of dark chocolate at full power for 1 minute, then stir. Microwave again at full power for 45 seconds to 1 minute, then stir until the mixture is well blended. Alternatively, you can melt the two together in a medium-sized saucepan over low heat until melted and mixed together. Set aside to cool slightly while you prepare the rest of the recipe.
3. Add the granulated sugar to a medium-sized mixing bowl, then sift in the all-purpose flour, dutch processed cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt. Then, whisk it all together. The sifting is optional, but highly recommended as it helps to incorporate all the ingredients.
4. In a separate large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, whole milk ricotta cheese, and vanilla extract until well combined. It should be smooth in texture and light yellow in color.
5. With a spatula, fold in the whisked dry ingredients until partially blended. Then, stir in the melted butter and chocolate mixture. The batter will be thick and on the heavier side but airy.
6. Transfer the batter into the prepared springform pan and top with additional mini semi-sweet chocolate chips. Bake for 40 minutes or until an inserted toothpick into the center of the cake comes out clean. The center may have a little jiggle to it—this is okay. A lot of jiggle, bake it for another 3-5 minutes.
7. Let the cake cool for at least 20 minutes before releasing it from the springform pan. Allow the cake to cool completely before serving.
8. Keep any leftover chocolate ricotta cake stored in an airtight container or plated and wrapped in plastic wrap at room temperature for up to 3 days. To keep it fresh longer, you can store the cake in the refrigerator for up to a week.
