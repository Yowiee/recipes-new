## Ingredients

- 6 Arnott’s Salada Original Crispbread
- 160g (1 cup, lightly packed) brown sugar
- 125g salted butter, chopped
- 2 x 180g blocks dark chocolate, melted
- 100g white chocolate, melted
- 50g green and red M&M’s Minis
- Silver cachous, to decorate

## Directions

Line a slice pan with baking paper, then line the pan with Arnott’s Salada Original Crispbreads.
Combine the sugar and butter in a small saucepan. Cook, stirring, over medium heat until butter melts and the mixture is smooth. Bring to the boil. Cook, stirring, for 30 seconds or until thickened.
Pour the sugar mixture evenly over the crispbread. Place in the oven and bake for 5 minutes or until sugar mixture is bubbling.
Pour the dark chocolate over the crispbread and use a palette knife to smooth. Set aside until set.
Drizzle over white chocolate and sprinkle with M&M’s and cachous. Set aside until set completely. Break into pieces to serve.
