## Ingredients

- 310ml (1 1/4 cups) milk
- 2 tsp dried yeast
- Pinch of caster sugar, plus extra 55g (1/4 cup)
- 525g (3 1/2 cups) plain flour, plus extra to dust
- 1 tsp salt
- 60g butter, melted, cooled slightly
- 1 egg, lightly beaten

#### Filling
- 75g butter, chopped, at room temperature
- 110 g (1/2 cup, firmly packed) brown sugar
- 3 tsp ground cinnamon

#### Frosting
- 100g cream cheese, chopped, at room temperature
- 20g butter, at room temperature
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 150g (1 cup) icing sugar mixture
- 2 tbsp milk, optional

## Directions

1. Gently heat the milk in a heatproof jug in the microwave until just lukewarm. Add yeast and a pinch of sugar, then stir to combine. Set aside for 5 minutes or until becoming frothy on top.
2. Place the flour, extra sugar and salt in a large bowl and make a well in the centre. Add the milk mixture, butter and egg. Mix with a wooden spoon to combine, then use your hands to gather the dough.
3. Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 minutes or until smooth and elastic. Place in an oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap or a clean tea towel. Stand in a draught-free place for 1 hour or until doubled in size.
4. Meanwhile, to make the filling, use a silicon spatula to combine the butter, sugar and cinnamon until smooth. Preheat oven to 180°C/160°C fan forced. Lightly grease a 4cm-deep, 21cm x 31cm (base size) pan and line the base with baking paper.
5. Punch the air out of the dough and transfer to a lightly floured surface. Shape into a rough rectangle. Use a rolling pin to roll out to a rectangle about 25cm x 40cm. Spread with the filling, all the way to the edges.
6. Starting at 1 short end, roll up dough into an even log shape. Use a large sharp knife to gently cut into 12 slices. Arrange the rolls, cut-side up, in the pan, placing them slightly apart. Cover again and stand for 20 minutes or until risen to fill the pan.
7. Bake the rolls for 25 minutes or until golden brown.
8. Meanwhile, to make the frosting, use electric beaters to beat the cream cheese, butter and vanilla until combined and smooth. Add the icing sugar and beat until combined. You can leave the frosting thick, or add a little milk to thin it out and make it more like a glaze (which we did).
9. Use a knife to loosen the rolls from the edges of the pan. Place a board over the pan and carefully invert rolls onto it, then immediately turn right-side up. Cool for 5 minutes, then spread warm rolls with the frosting. Separate to serve warm or at room temperature.
