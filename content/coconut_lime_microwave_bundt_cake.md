## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups (160 grams) all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon fine sea salt
- ½ cup (112 grams) solid virgin coconut oil
- ¾ cup (150 grams) sugar
- 1 lime
- 2 large eggs, room temperature
- ¾ cup plus 1 to 2 tablespoons well-stirred full fat coconut milk, divided
- 1½ teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 cup (120 grams) confectioners’ sugar
- ½ cup large flake unsweetened coconut flakes

## Directions

1. Mist a 8 ½-inch silicone Bundt pan with cooking spray; set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt; set aside.
2. Put the sugar in a large mixing bowl and zest the lime with a Microplane over the bowl to capture the aromatic oils and zest. Add the coconut oil and beat with a handheld mixer until light and fluffy, 2 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition. Add the vanilla and beat to combine. Add the flour mixture and beat until combined. Do not over-beat or the cake will be tough.
3. Pour the batter into the pan, cover loosely with plastic wrap and place in the center of the microwave. Microwave on high for about 1 minute. Stop and rotate the cake and microwave for 2 more minutes. Carefully remove the plastic wrap (beware of steam) and pull the outside edge of the cake away from the edge of the pan. If liquid batter pools on the bottom of the pan, re-cover and microwave in 30-second bursts until done. A cake baked in a 900-watt microwave will take 5 ½ minutes total.
4. Use oven mitts to remove the cake from the oven. Let it stand for 5 minutes. Discard the plastic wrap, place a large plate on top of the pan and quickly invert the set up so the cake falls onto the plate. Let cool for at least 30 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, place the coconut flakes on a microwave-safe plate and microwave on high, stirring occasionally, until golden brown in places, about 3 minutes; set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together the confectioners’ sugar, 1 tablespoon of lime juice, and the remaining 1 to 2 tablespoons of coconut milk to make a thick glaze; cover and set aside.
6. When the cake is cool, spread the glaze over the cake and sprinkle with the toasted coconut. Cut into wedges and serve. Leftover cake can be stored at room temperature, tightly covered in plastic, for up to 4 days.
