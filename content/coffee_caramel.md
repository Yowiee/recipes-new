## Ingredients

- 250 ml (1 cup) cream (35% fat)
- 250 g sugar
- 4 shots strong espresso
- 1 tsp sea salt
- 100 g dark chocolate (70% cocoa)

## Directions

 1. Heat the cream in a small saucepan to just below simmering point. 
 2. In a heavy-based saucepan, melt the sugar over medium heat, without stirring, until you have a golden-brown caramel. Brush the sides of the pot with water and a pastry brush occasionally so crystals do not form.
 3. Slowly add the cream â€“ be careful, as it could splatter and overflow if you pour in too much cream at once. 
 4. Once the cream is fully incorporated, let it boil for 1 minute.
 5. Add the espresso and salt and bring back to the boil. 
 6. Take off the heat and whisk in the chocolate until smooth.
