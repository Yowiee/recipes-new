## Ingredients

- 2 c (454g) heavy cream
- 2 Tbsp (10g) ground coffee
- 1/2 tsp fine salt
- 1/2 c (100g) sugar
- 4 egg yolks
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- sugar for topping

## Directions

1. Heat heavy cream, coffee, and salt over medium heat until it comes just below a boil. Remove from the heat and let steep for 20 minutes.
2. Add sugar to a medium pot set over low heat. Stir gently to even out the cooking and cook until it reaches a light amber color. Turn off the heat.
3. Slowly strain in the coffee cream. It will bubble up, so add just a little at first and then finish with the rest. Pour into a separate bowl or cup and let cool until only slightly warm.
4. Add egg yolks to a medium bowl and slowly pour in the coffee caramel cream. Stir constantly to ensure that the egg yolks do not cook. 
5. Finish with the vanilla.
6. Divide between 6 ramekins set in a 13in x 9in lamington pan.
7. Place the lamington pan in a pre-heated 160Â°C oven and fill about a third of the way with hot water.
8. Bake for 25 minutes or until the custard wobbles slightly when tapped.
9. Remove from the oven, let cool on the counter for 20 minutes, and then at least 4 hours in the fridge.
10. Top with a thin layer of sugar and brulee with a torch or using the broiler setting on your oven.
