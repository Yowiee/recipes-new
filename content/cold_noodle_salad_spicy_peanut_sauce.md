## Ingredients

- Kosher salt and black pepper
- ½ cup low-sodium soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil
- 2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
- 2 teaspoons grated peeled ginger
- 1 teaspoon grated garlic
- 450 g angel hair pasta, noodles broken into thirds
- 2 tablespoons safflower or canola oil
- 1 small yellow onion, halved and thinly sliced
- 3 red or yellow medium bell peppers, cored, seeded and sliced lengthwise ⅛-inch thick
- 240 g snap peas, halved lengthwise
- 240 g cherry tomatoes, halved
- ¼ cup thinly sliced scallions, plus more for garnish
- Toasted white sesame seeds, for garnish (optional)

## Directions

1. Bring a pot of water to a boil, and season generously with salt.
2. In a small bowl, combine soy sauce, sesame oil, vinegar, ginger and garlic. Season with salt and pepper, and mix well.
3. Once the water boils, cook the pasta according to package directions until al dente. Reserve ¾ cup pasta cooking water, then drain. Transfer pasta to a large bowl. Add half the dressing and ¼ cup pasta water, season with salt and pepper and toss to evenly coat.
4. Meanwhile, in a large deep-sided saucepan, heat safflower oil over medium. Add onion and bell peppers, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until deep golden and tender, about 10 minutes. Add snap peas and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp-tender, 2 minutes. Add tomatoes, ¼ cup pasta water and the remaining dressing. Stir to deglaze the pan and lift the browned bits on the bottom of the skillet, then add vegetable mixture (with sauce) and scallions to pasta and toss until well combined (add more pasta water if thinner sauce is desired). Season with salt and pepper.
5. Serve warm or at room temperature. Garnish with scallions and sesame seeds, if using.
