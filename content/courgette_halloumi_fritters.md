## Ingredients

- 2-3 zucchini, coarsely grated (500g)
- Sea salt and black pepper
- 50g plain flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 3 tbsp fine breadcrumbs
- 1 bunch spring onions, trimmed and finely sliced
- Â½ bunch mint, leaves picked and finely chopped
- 1 block halloumi (about 225g), coarsely grated
- 2 large eggs, beaten (plus 4 extra if serving with poached eggs)
- Olive oil, for frying
- Chilli jam, to serve

## Directions

1. Put the grated zucchini in a colander in the sink, toss them with a teaspoon of salt and leave for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, put the plain flour, baking powder and breadcrumbs in a large bowl, add ground black pepper to taste and mix to combine.
2. When the zucchini have had their 10 minutes, squeeze them really well to get rid of the excess water, then transfer to the bowl with the flour mix. Toss to combine, making sure the zucchini are well coated. Add the sliced spring onions, chopped mint and grated halloumi, and stir well. Mix in the eggs and stir again.
3. If serving with eggs, put a pan of water on to boil for the poached or boiled eggs, and cook to your liking.
4. Divide the fritter mixture into 12: each should roughly be the size of one heaped tablespoon. Put a large frying pan on a medium heat, add a few tablespoons of olive oil, then fry the fritters, in batches if need be, for about four minutes on each side. Serve topped with a generous dollop of chilli jam and a poached egg or a peeled and halved boiled egg, if you like.
