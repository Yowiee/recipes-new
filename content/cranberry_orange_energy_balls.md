## Ingredients

- 1 cup pitted Medjool dates (about 8 dates)
- ⅓ cup unsweetened dried cranberries
- ¼ cup smooth natural almond butter
- ¼ cup unsweetened shredded coconut
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1⅓ cups old-fashioned rolled oats
- 1 tablespoon grated orange zest
- 2 tablespoons orange juice
- ½ teaspoon salt

## Directions

1. Place 1 cup dates, ⅓ cup cranberries, ¼ cup each almond butter and coconut and 2 tablespoons honey in a food processor; pulse until coarsely chopped, about 8 (1-second) pulses. 
2. Add 1⅓ cups oats, 1 tablespoon orange zest, 2 tablespoons orange juice and ½ teaspoon salt; process until the mixture is crumbly but holds its shape when squeezed, 15 to 20 seconds. 
3. Transfer to a medium bowl. Cover and refrigerate for 10 minutes.
4. Using a 1-tablespoon measure, roll the date mixture into balls; place on a sheet of wax paper or parchment paper. Serve immediately or transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 1 week.
