## Ingredients

#### For the Cream Cheese Batter
- 225 g cream cheese, softened
- 1 large egg
- 3 grams icing sugar
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

#### For the Cocoa Batter
- 14 grams unsalted butter, plus more for the pan
- 200 grams granulated sugar
- 50 grams semisweet chocolate chips
- 2 large eggs
- 1½ teaspoons vanilla extract
- 100 grams all-purpose flour
- 70 grams unsweetened cocoa powder (Dutch-processed or natural)
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ¾ teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 170°C. Butter and line an 8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang on 2 sides to make a sling. Lightly butter the parchment.
2. Make the cream cheese batter: In a medium bowl, beat together the cream cheese, egg, powdered sugar, flour and vanilla until well combined.
3. Prepare the cocoa batter: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the butter and sugar. Cook, stirring, until the butter is melted, then remove the pot from the heat. Whisk vigorously until the mixture is homogenous and opaque and the sugar has dissolved, about 4 minutes. Add the chocolate and let stand 1 minute. Whisk to combine.
4. Add the eggs and vanilla and whisk until smooth. Add the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt and stir to combine. Transfer about two-thirds of the cocoa batter to the prepared pan and spread in an even layer.
5. Spread the cream cheese batter evenly over the cocoa batter, then dollop the remaining one-third of the cocoa batter over the cream cheese layer. Using a butter knife, swirl the batters together in a decorative pattern.
6. Bake until the brownies are set and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with moist crumbs attached, 24 to 28 minutes. Transfer the pan to a rack to cool completely.
7. To serve, use the parchment overhang to lift the brownie out of the pan and transfer to a cutting board. Cut into squares. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.
