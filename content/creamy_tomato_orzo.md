## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 5 cloves garlic minced
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon red chili flakes
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 4 tablespoons tomato paste
- 2 cups vegetable broth
- 1 cup cream
- 1 cup uncooked orzo
- 15 ounce can chickpeas drained and rinsed
- 2 cups baby spinach sliced
- 1/2 cup fresh basil chopped
- optional: 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese

## Directions

1. In a large sauté pan over low-medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant.
2. Add the dried oregano, red chili flakes, salt, pepper and tomato paste and stir. Pour in the broth and cream and stir well to combine. Now add the uncooked orzo and chickpeas and bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer, uncovered, for about 10 minutes, stirring frequently.
3. Stir in the baby spinach, basil and parmesan. Stir until the spinach wilts and the parmesan melts. Add a bit more broth or water if it gets too thick. Remove from heat. Serve with additional fresh basil leaves, grated parmesan and fresh bread, if desired.
