## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons coconut oil or peanut oil (or olive oil)
- 1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped, to yield 1-1.5 cups
- 4 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled
- Kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger
- 2 teaspoons yellow or brown mustard seeds
- 2 teaspoons ground turmeric
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin or fennel
- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 3 1⁄2 cups water
- 400g can unsweetened coconut milk
- 1/2 cup red lentils
- 1/2 cup French green lentils
- 180g kale (or baby spinach), about 6 cups, leaves removed from stems, roughly chopped
- fresh lime, for serving, optional
- cashews, for serving, optional

## Directions

1. In a large pot over medium-high, combine the oil, onion, garlic and 1 teaspoon salt. When you hear a sizzle, cover the pot, turn heat to low, and cook, stirring every so often, until the onion has softened and is just beginning to color, 7 to 9 minutes. 
2. Stir in the ginger, the mustard seeds, turmeric, coriander, fennel and red pepper flakes. Cook, stirring often, until fragrant, about 1 minute. 
3. Add the water, coconut milk, lentils, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, then bring to a boil. Reduce to low, cover and simmer, stirring once or twice, until the lentils have broken down, 40 to 50 minutes.
4. Stir in the kale and return to a simmer. Taste and season with salt if desired. Serve immediately or cool and refrigerate for a future day — it’s good cold straight from the fridge.
