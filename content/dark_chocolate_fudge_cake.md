#### Notes
- Be careful to not over-mix the cake batter! If it’s mixed too much, the cake may become tough and not rise properly.
- If you’re unsure the cake is baked after the time listed below, you can use a cake tester or tooth pick. If it comes clean, the cake is baked through!
- Let the cake cool COMPLETELY before frosting it.
- Make sure the butter and milk are room temperature before mixing the frosting.
- Remember to sift the cocoa powder and powdered sugar!
- If frosting is too thick, you can add a little more milk.
- You can divide this cake into 2 layers. If you do, double the frosting for middle filled and top covered. Triple the frosting if you want to frost the whole cake.
