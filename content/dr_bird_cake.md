## Ingredients

- 3 cups (450g) all-purpose flour
- 2 cups (400g) white sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups banana, coarsely chopped
- 1 (225g) can crushed pineapple, with juice
- 1 cup (225g) vegetable oil
- 3 large eggs

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 175°C (165°C fan).  Grease and flour a 10-inch ring cake tin.
2. Mix together flour, sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add banana, pineapple with juice, oil, and eggs. Mix well and pour into the prepared pan.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of cake comes out clean, 70 to 80 minutes. Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
