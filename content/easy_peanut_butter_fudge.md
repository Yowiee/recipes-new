## Ingredients

- 340g white chocolate melts or chips
- 280g smooth peanut butter (see note)
- 1 can sweetened condensed milk

## Directions

1. Line a 20cm square pan with baking paper that covers the sides of the pan.
2. Place the white chocolate chips and peanut butter in a large bowl and microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring well after each, until well combined and smooth. It should only take a minute or two.
3. Gently stir in the sweetened condensed milk until no more streaks remain. It will thicken quite a bit.
4. Quickly transfer the mixture to the lined pan and spread evenly. Refrigerate the fudge until firm, 2-3 hours. The fudge will look a little glossy when you first add it to the pan and look more matte as it sets.
5. Cut the fudge and store in an air tight container. Fudge can be stored at either room temperature or the fridge. It will be softer at room temperature.

#### Note:
- Do not use an all natural peanut butter. The oil separates from the peanut butter, making it difficult to get the right consistency.
