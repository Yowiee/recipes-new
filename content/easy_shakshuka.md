## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ½ small red onion, finely diced
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 400g can diced tomatoes
- ½ red capsicum, de-seeded and diced
- ½ teaspoon cumin
- ½ teaspoon sweet paprika
- Pinch of chilli flakes (optional)
- ½ teaspoon sugar
- ½ teaspoon salt
- Freshly ground pepper, to taste
- ½ cup baby spinach leaves
- 100g feta, crumbled
- 3 eggs

## Directions

1. Heat the oil in a large frypan over medium heat. Add the diced red onion and sauté for about two minutes until it starts to soften.
2. Add minced garlic and stir in tomato paste. Sauté for a further two minutes.
3. Stir through the can of diced tomatoes and capsicum. Add cumin, paprika, chilli flakes and sugar. Season with salt and freshly ground pepper. Stir to combine. Reduce heat and cook for another 10 minutes until the vegetables are tender and tomato sauce reduces and thickens slightly.
4. Stir in spinach leaves and cook until wilted, about two minutes.
5. Make three small wells in the sauce with the back of a spoon. Crack an egg into each well. Cover the frypan and cook for about five to eight minutes, or until the eggs are done to your liking. Once the eggs are cooked, remove the skillet from the heat.
6. Garnish with a handful of fresh chopped parsley and crumbled feta. Serve hot with Lebanese or pita bread or a crusty baguette on the side for dipping.
