## Ingredients

- 450g prepared pizza dough (homemade or store-bought)
- All-purpose flour, for sprinkling
- 16 thin-cut slices Genoa salami (150g)
- 8 thick-cut slices capicola ham (150g)
- 16 slices provolone (125g)
- 1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella
- 1 cup roasted red capsicum, drained
- 1 tablespoon drained capers
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten
- 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan, for sprinkling

## Directions

1. Heat the oven to 200°C. Place an oven rack in the lower third of the oven.
2. Roll out the dough. Lay a 40cm sheet of parchment paper on the counter and dust it with flour. Roll the dough on the floured parchment paper to a 35 x 27 cm rectangle.
3. Add the filling: Layer the salami on the dough to within 1/2-inch of the edges, and overlap the slices so that no dough shows beneath the salami. Add provolone, followed by the ham, mozzarella, and then the peppadews. Finally, sprinkle with capers.
4. Roll up the dough:
5. Brush the edges of the dough with egg. Using the parchment to help you, lift up one long end and start rolling. Continue rolling until the seam on the log is on the bottom. Pinch the ends so they don't open and tuck the dough under the roll.
6. Transfer to the baking sheet:
7. Using the parchment paper as a sling, transfer the log on the paper to the baking sheet. Brush all over with egg and sprinkle with Parmesan. Use a paring knife to cut diagonal slits at 1-inch intervals all along the top.
8. Bake the stromboli: Bake the stromboli for 15 minutes. Turn the oven down to 180°F and continue baking for 25 minutes, or until the log is golden and the cheese is oozing at the slits.
9. Cool and serve: Cool on the pan for about 10 minutes. Cut into slices along the slits. Serve immediately while hot; stromboli is also delicious at room temperature.
