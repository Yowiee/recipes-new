## Ingredients

- 20 savoiardi biscuits
- 4 mini jam sponge rolls
- 2 tbsp water
- 1 tbsp gelatine powder
- 500g tub Pauls Double Thick French Vanilla Creamy Custard
- 600ml ctn thickened cream
- 170g punnet fresh raspberries
- 85g pkt raspberry-flavoured jelly crystals
- 250ml (1 cup) boiling water
- Extra fresh raspberries, to decorate


## Directions

1. Release the base of a 21cm (base size) springform pan. Invert the base and then line with baking paper, allowing the edge of the paper to overhang. Trim 1 end of the savoiardi biscuits so they are about 8cm in length (reserve offcuts for another use). Arrange biscuits vertically, curve end at the top, around the inside edge of the pan. Cut each sponge roll into 5 even slices. Arrange the slices over the base, as close together as possible, trimming to fit (don’t worry if there are a few little gaps here and there). Reserve any remaining sponge roll slices.
2. Place water in a small bowl. Sprinkle with the gelatine and whisk with a fork to combine. Set aside. Place custard in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir constantly for 4-5 minutes or until hot. Remove from the heat and stir in the gelatine mixture until it’s completely dissolved. Place in the fridge for 20 minutes to cool slightly.
3. Use electric beaters to beat 300ml of cream in a large bowl until firm peaks just form. Add the cooled custard mixture and gently fold until well combined. Scatter the raspberries over the sponge roll base. Pour in the custard mixture and smooth the surface. Place in the fridge for 1 hour to set.
4. Meanwhile, place the jelly crystals in a heatproof bowl. Add boiling water and stir until the crystals dissolve. Place in the fridge, stirring occasionally, for 40 minutes or until thickened.
5. Pour jelly mixture over the top of the cake. Place in the fridge for 4 hours, or overnight, until set.
6. Just before serving, release the cake from the pan and transfer to a serving plate. Use electric beaters to beat the remaining 300ml cream in a bowl until firm peaks form, then dollop on top of the cake. Decorate with the extra raspberries and reserved sponge roll slices
