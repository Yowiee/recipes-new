## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 brown onion, coarsely chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, crushed
- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 1/2 tsp ground turmeric
- 2 x 420g can lentils, rinsed, drained
- 625ml (2 1/2 cups) vegetable stock
- 400ml can coconut milk
- 120g pkt baby spinach
- 4 eggs
- Fresh coriander leaves, to serve (optional)
- Flatbread, warmed, to serve

## Directions

1. Heat the oil in a large, non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and garlic. Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes or until onion softens slightly. Add the curry powder and turmeric. Cook, stirring, for 30 seconds or until aromatic.
2. Add the lentils, stock and 350ml coconut milk to the pan and stir to combine. Season. Bring to the boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 5-7 minutes or until thickened slightly. Add the spinach, then use the back of a wooden spoon to gently push down and submerge the leaves in the lentil mixture.
3. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Carefully crack each egg on top of the lentil mixture (it will sink slightly into the mixture), making sure to space them apart. Cook, covered, for 4-5 minutes or until the egg whites are cooked through and the yolks are still soft (or to your liking).
4. Remove pan from the heat and drizzle with remaining coconut milk. Season with freshly cracked black pepper and top with coriander leaves, if using. Serve with flatbread.
