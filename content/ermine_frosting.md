## Ingredients

- 215g (1 cup) caster sugar
- 50g (1/3 cup) plain flour
- 250ml (1 cup) milk
- 200g butter, chopped, at room temperature
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

## Directions

1. Place the sugar and flour in a saucepan and stir until combined. Gradually add the milk, whisking until smooth after each addition. Place over low heat and cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture starts to boil and thicken. Cook, whisking vigorously, for a further 1 minute.
2. Transfer mixture to a bowl. Set aside, whisking occasionally, for 5 minutes to cool slightly. Cover the surface of the mixture with plastic wrap. Place in the fridge for 1 hour 30 minutes or until cooled completely.
3. Use electric beaters to beat the butter in a bowl until pale and creamy. Add the milk mixture, 1 tablespoonful of the milk mixture at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the vanilla and beat until well combined.
