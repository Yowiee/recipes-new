## Ingredients

- 800g canned fava beans, drained and rinsed (see Tips above for sourcing them)
- 400g canned chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 clove garlic, crushed
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus extra for serving
- Juice of one lemon

#### To serve:
- Olive oil
- Tomatoes, diced
- Fresh parsley, chopped
- Fresh mint, chopped
- Green onion, thinly sliced
- Red onion, finely diced
- Radish, diced

## Directions

1. Drain and rinse the canned fava beans and chickpeas. Place both in a large saucepan with enough clean water to cover them and add the ground cumin. Bring to a boil then allow to simmer for about 5 minutes.
2. Remove about three quarters of the fava beans and chickpeas from the liquid and place in a large bowl, do not discard cooking liquid. Roughly mash the fava beans and chickpeas in the bowl with the garlic, salt, lemon juice and olive oil.
3. Add the remaining fava beans and chickpeas to the bowl with about a third of a cup of the cooking liquid. Adjust lemon juice and salt taste. Mix together. You should have a thick porridge like consistency. Add more cooking liquid if you would want it less thick.
4. To serve, add warm ful medames to a bowl. Top with diced tomatoes, freshly chopped mint, parsley, green onions, and red onion. Add a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil over the top and enjoy with Lebanese pita bread
