## Ingredients

- 250g cream cheese, chopped, at room temperature
- 90g unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 120g (3/4 cup) plain flour
- 5 eggs, separated
- 60ml (1/4 cup) milk, at room temperature
- 120ml (1/2 cup) passionfruit pulp
- zest 1 lemon
- 110g (1/2 cup) caster sugar
- Icing sugar, to dust

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 140°C/120°C fan forced. Line base of a deep, 20cm round cake pan with baking paper.
2. Use electric beaters to beat the cream cheese and butter in a large bowl until smooth. Add flour and beat until just combined. Add egg yolks and beat until smooth. Slowly add milk, lemon zest and passionfruit and beat until well combined.
3. Use clean electric beaters to beat the egg whites until soft peaks form. Gradually add the caster sugar, beating well after each addition to ensure the sugar is dissolved. Use a large metal spoon to carefully fold the meringue into the passionfruit mixture, in 3 batches. (Try to keep the mixture as aerated as possible).
4. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan, tap the pan firmly on the bench to release large air bubbles. Use a skewer to prick the large holes. Use a palette knife to smooth the surface.
5. Place the cake in a shallow heatproof tray. Pour enough boiling water into the tray to come 2cm up the side of the pan. Bake for 1 1/2 hours or until golden brown and set. Turn the oven off. Leave cheesecake to cool in oven for 10 minutes with the door ajar.
6. Remove the cheesecake from the tray and set aside to cool, in the pan, until warm. Run a knife around the edge of the pan. Carefully invert cheesecake onto a plate lined with baking paper. Remove paper lining and quickly and gently invert back onto the serving plate. Set aside to cool completely.
7. Dust the cake with icing sugar before cutting into wedges to serve.
