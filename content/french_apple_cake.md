## Ingredients

- 1 cup (130g) all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 2 large eggs, room temperature
- 1 cup (200g) granulated sugar
- 2 tablespoons rum
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 140g unsalted butter, melted and cooled to room temperature
- 5 to 6 medium apples (about 900g), peeled, cored, and diced into 1/2-inch cubest

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 180°C (160°C fan-forced). Grease and line the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. 
3. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, sugar, rum, and vanilla extract. 
4. Add half of the dry ingredients to the egg mixture and whisk to combine. Add the melted butter and whisk to combine. Add the remaining dry ingredients and whisk until just a few streaks of flour remain.
5. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the apples into the batter just until combined. Spread the batter into the lined pan and smooth the top with an offset spatula.
6. Bake until the top is golden and a toothpick inserted in the center of the pan comes out clean, about 1 hour. The cake will be very moist.
7. Transfer the pan to a wire rack. Allow to cool, then sprinkle with confectioner’s sugar, if desired.
