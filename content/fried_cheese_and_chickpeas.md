## Ingredients

- Extra virgin olive oil or ghee
- 300g frying cheese (such as queso de freir, queso blanco, halloumi or paneer), cut into ¼ inch slices and patted dry
- 1 yellow onion, thinly sliced
- 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 1 tsp ground cayenne
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 1 tsp ground ginger
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 cinnamon stick or ½ tsp ground cinnamon
- 1 tsp kosher salt, such as Diamond Crystal (use ½ tsp if using halloumi)
- ½ tsp granulated sugar
- 800g can diced, puréed or crushed tomatoes
- 420g can chickpeas, drained
- Handful of corriander leaves
- Flatbread or rice, to serve

## Directions

1. Heat a large (12-inch skillet) on medium-high until very hot, 2 to 3 minutes. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil or ghee and swirl it around to coat the base. Add the cheese and fry until golden, 1 to 1½ minutes. Flip and cook the other side. Transfer the cooked cheese to a plate and set aside.
2. Place the same pan over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil or ghee, along with the onions and stir until slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic, cayenne, turmeric, ginger, cumin and cinnamon and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the salt, sugar, tomatoes and chickpeas and stir well to combine.
3. Cover and cook on medium, stirring occasionally and reducing the heat as necessary, until the tomatoes have thickened up, 8 to 10 minutes. Taste and season with more salt if required.
4. Place the cheese on top of the sauce, and cook just until warmed through, 2 minutes.
5. To serve, top with corriander and serve with flatbread or rice.
