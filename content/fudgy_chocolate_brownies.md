## Ingredients

- 227g unsalted butter
- 57g dark chocolate (around 70%), chopped
- 113g unsweetened chocolate, chopped
- ½ cup (42g) Dutch-process cocoa powder
- 5 large eggs, room temperature
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 2¼ cups (450g) superfine sugar
- 1 cup (140g) all-purpose flour*
- 1 teaspoon table salt
- 227g chocolate chips

## Directions


1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C) and prepare 9x13in baking pan with nonstick baking spray and a parchment paper sling across the width of the pan.
2. Add the butter, both chocolates, and half the sugar (225g) to a medium bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Stir together with a silicone spatula until the butter and chocolate have melted. Once melted, remove from the heat and immediately mix in the cocoa powder.
3. Add the eggs, vanilla, and remaining half (225g) of the superfine sugar to a mixing bowl. Whisk together on medium speed until lightened in color and nearly tripled in volume.
4. Add the chocolate mixture to the sugar and eggs and mix until combined.
5. Switch to the paddle attachment and add the flour and salt. Mix until nearly all of the way incorporated.
6. Stop the mixer and add the chocolate chips. Mix until fully combined and no streaks of dry flour remain.
7. Smooth out in the prepared pan and bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with streaks of thick batter (the toothpick should not come out clean nor should it come out entirely coated with shiny, wet batter).
8. Remove from the oven and set the pan on a baking rack to cool completely.
9. Once cool, lift out using the parchment paper sling and cut into squares.

- Or try making the brownies gluten-free by replacing the all-purpose flour with an equal weight of a gluten-free flour blend (I used the Measure for Measure blend from King Arthur Baking), almond flour, or mochi flour (sweet rice flour)
