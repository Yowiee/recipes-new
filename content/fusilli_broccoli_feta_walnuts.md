## Ingredients

- 500g fusilli or other short pasta
- 2 heads of broccoli, including stem (750g)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil 
- 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- ½ -1 teaspoon red chilli flakes, plus more to serve
- Sea salt and black pepper
- 200g Greek feta
- Zest and juice of 1 lemon
- 100g (1 cup) roasted walnuts, roughly chopped. See roasting tips above if using raw walnuts

## Directions

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil and add the pasta. Cook according to packet instructions, until just al dente.
2. Finely chop the broccoli into small pieces, around 1-2 centimetres (see photo above). Remove the woody exterior from the stem and chop that up too.
3. Heat a large frying pan on medium-high, add 2 tablespoons of oil, and add the chopped broccoli, and toss for 2 minutes until starting to soften. Add the garlic and chilli flakes, season with 1 teaspoon of sea salt and a few pinches of black pepper and toss to combine.
4. Reduce heat to medium, ladle ½ cup (125ml) of the pasta water into the pan with the broccoli and stir for 2 minutes until the broccoli is bright green and softened, but still with a bite. When the pasta is ready, use a slotted spoon to transfer it directly to the broccoli (keep the cooking water). Add another 1 cup (250ml) of pasta cooking water, the feta, lemon zest, more black pepper and stir until the feta is melted through the pasta. If it looks dry, add some more pasta cooking water; you are looking for a loose sauce. Taste and, if needed, season with salt.
5. Divide the pasta amongst four serving bowls and top each with a squeeze of lemon juice, season with salt, scatter with red chilli flakes and finish with walnuts.
