## Ingredients

- ½ cup (113g) butter, plus extra for greasing
- 4 eggs, separated
- ¾ cup (150g) coconut sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1⅔ cups (250g) rice flour
- Grated zest of 1 lemon
- 2 tsp baking powder
- ⅔ cup (150ml) milk
- 3 apples, thinly sliced
- 1 tbsp honey
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon

#### Whipped coconut cream
- 1 x 400ml can coconut milk, refrigerated overnight
- ½ tsp vanilla extract
- 1 tsp honey

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 180°C. Grease and line a 20cm springform cake pan with baking paper. Whisk the egg yolks, butter, sugar and vanilla extract together. Add the rice flour, lemon zest, baking powder and milk and whisk to combine. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites to stiff peaks and then gently fold into the batter.
2. Pour the batter into the pan. Arrange the apple slices on top. Bake for 40 minutes or until a skewer inserted in the centre comes out clean. Leave to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack. Brush with honey and dust with cinnamon.
3. To make the whipped coconut cream, remove the coconut milk from the fridge and scrape off the solid coconut fat. Place coconut milk in a food processor or blender with the remaining ingredients. Whisk for 3 to 5 minutes until light and fluffy, then use immediately.
4. Brush the cake with honey and dust with cinnamon. Serve with a dollop of the whipped coconut cream, if desired.p to 3 days. To keep it fresh longer, you can store the cake in the refrigerator for up to a week.
