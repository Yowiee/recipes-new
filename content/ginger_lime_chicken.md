## Ingredients

- 600-800g boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts
- Salt and black pepper
- ⅓ cup mayonnaise
- 1 tablespoon lime zest (from about 2 limes), plus lime wedges, for serving
- 1 tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger (from a 3-inch piece of peeled ginger)

## Directions

1. Pat the chicken dry and season all over with 1½ teaspoons salt. In a medium bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, lime zest and ginger; season with salt and pepper. Add the chicken to the mayonnaise mixture and stir to coat. (The chicken can sit in the marinade for up to 8 hours in the fridge. Let come to room temperature before cooking.)
2. To grill: Heat a grill to medium-high. Grill the chicken over direct heat until cooked through and juices run clear, about 5 minutes per side for thighs and about 4 minutes per side for breasts, turning as necessary to avoid burning.
3. To cook in a skillet: Heat a large skillet over medium-high. Cook the chicken until juices run clear, about 5 minutes per side for thighs and about 4 minutes per side for breasts.
4. Serve chicken with lime wedges, for squeezing on top.

#### Notes:
1. Substituted the cream for a tin of evaporated milk and reduced the water accordingly.
