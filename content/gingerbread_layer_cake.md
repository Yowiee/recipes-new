## Ingredients

#### For the Cake
- 180 ml vegetable oil, plus more for the pan
- 288 g all-purpose flour
- 2 tsp ground ginger
- 1½ tsp ground cinnamon
- 1½ tsp salt 
- ¾ tsp baking powder
- ¾ tsp baking soda
- ½ tsp ground cardamom
- ¼ tsp ground cloves
- 220 g  brown sugar
- 120 ml golden syrup
- 120 ml honey
- 2 large eggs
- 180 ml yogurt (not Greek)

#### For the Frosting
- 475 ml heavy cream
- 225 g mascarpone cheese
- 105 g powdered sugar
- 1 tbs vanilla bean paste or pure vanilla extract


## Directions

1. Heat the oven to 180°C (160°C fan). Prepare the cake: Oil three 8-inch round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment. Lightly oil the parchment.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, ginger, cinnamon, salt, baking powder, baking soda, cardamom and cloves.
3. In a large bowl, whisk together the oil, brown sugar, molasses, honey, eggs and yogurt. Add the dry ingredients and, using a large whisk, mix them into the wet ingredients until just combined.
4. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared pans. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with moist crumbs attached, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool for about 20 minutes. Run a knife around the edges of each cake layer and flip them out onto a rack to cool completely.
5. Prepare the frosting: In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat together the heavy cream, mascarpone, powdered sugar and vanilla bean paste until stiff peaks form.
6. Transfer one cake layer to a serving plate. Top with about 1½ cups frosting, spreading it in an even layer but leaving a 1-inch border. Top with another cake layer and another 1½ cups frosting. Top with remaining cake layer and frosting. (Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to three days but allow to come to room temperature to serve.)
