## Ingredients

#### GINGERBREAD CAKE LAYERS
- 315 g all-purpose flour
- 150 g dark brown sugar
- ¾ teaspoon baking powder
- ¾ teaspoon baking soda
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- 2 ¼ teaspoon ground ginger
- 2 ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ½ teaspoon ground cloves
- 165 g unsulphured molasses or dark syrup
- 360 g sour cream 14-18% room temperature
- 110 g vegetable oil e.g. avocado oil or canola oil
- 3 large eggs room temperature
- 2 teaspoon vanilla extract

#### CREAM CHEESE FROSTING
- 300 g butter
- 150 g full-fat cream cheese
- 550 g powdered sugar
- ½ teaspoon vanilla paste


## Directions

#### GINGERBREAD CAKE LAYERS
1. Preheat the oven at 170ºC  (150°C fan) and line 2x 20 cm/8 inch baking pan with parchment paper.
2. In a large bowl, stir together the all-purpose flour, dark brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt and spices.
3. In another mixing bowl add all of the wet ingredients, and with a hand whisk, whisk them together until combined.
4. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Stir it all together with a whisk or a rubber spatula. Make sure there is no dry flour left in the batter.
5. Pour the cake batter into the prepared baking pans and spread the cake batter into an even layer. Bake them for 28-30 minutes or until a cake tester comes out clean.
6. Let the cakes cool on a cooling rack. After 5 minutes, gently remove the cakes from the cake tins and let the cakes cool down completely.

#### CREAM CHEESE FROSTING
1. Take the butter and cream cheese out of the fridge 10 minutes before starting. Cut the butter into cubes. Sift the powdered sugar.
2. In your stand mixer, using the paddle attachment, start by creaming the butter for 5 minutes on medium-high speed. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and give it another mix for 2 minutes.
3. Add the vanilla bean paste and cream cheese and cream it together with the butter for 1 minute.
4. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and on low speed, mix the sifted powdered sugar in 2 parts, letting the powdered sugar mix in with the butter and cream cheese before adding the next part. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and give it a final mix for 1-2 minutes on low speed.

#### ASSEMBLING
1. Place the first cake layer on your serving dish or cake board on your turntable. If you don’t have a turntable, don’t worry, you can easily decorate the cake without it.
2. Add 2 big scoops of frosting and with an offset spatula, even it out. Then add the other cake layer and cover the whole cake in a thin crumb coat. Place it in the refrigerator for 20 minutes so it is easier to frost the cake with the remaining buttercream.
3. Add the remaining frosting, and even it out over the cake. Optional decorate with a dusting of cinnamon and gingerbread cookies.
