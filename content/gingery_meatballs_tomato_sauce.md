## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons finely grated or minced fresh ginger
- 3 garlic cloves, finely grated or minced
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin, more for serving
- 1 teaspoon fine sea or table salt, more as needed
- ½ teaspoon ground coriander
- 450g pork mince (or turkey, chicken, beef, lamb or vegan meat)
- ½ cup panko bread crumbs (or use plain)
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh coriander leaves and tender stems, more for serving
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 cups diced fresh ripe or overripe tomatoes
- 1 teaspoon fish sauce or soy sauce
- 4 scallions, thinly sliced
- 1 lime, halved

## Directions

1. In a large bowl, mix together 1 tablespoon ginger, the garlic, cumin, salt and coriander. Add pork, panko and cilantro. Using your hands, gently mix everything together, making sure not to overwork the mixture. (Otherwise, the meatballs get tough.) Form into 30 mm balls.
2. Heat a large skillet over medium-high, then add the oil and let it heat up until it thins out. Add meatballs in one layer. Cook, turning and shaking the pan, until meatballs are browned all over, 5 to 7 minutes.

3. Move meatballs to one side of the pan, scraping up any browned bits. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon ginger to the empty side of the pan and sauté for 1 minute. Add tomatoes, fish sauce and a pinch of salt to the empty side of the pan. When tomatoes are simmering, cover the pan, lower the heat to medium, and let cook until the meatballs are no longer pink at the center, about 5 to 8 minutes longer.
4. Uncover the pan. Mix the scallions into the sauce. Squeeze lime juice all over everything, then stir together. Taste, and add salt and lime juice as needed. Serve the meatballs sprinkled with more cumin and topped with coriander.
