## Ingredients

- 3 large (or 6 medium) zucchini
- 2 tsps salt, divided
- 2 eggs large
- 1 cup grated feta
- 1/2 tsp ground black pepper
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil
- 1/2 cup breadcrumbs plain
- 1/4 cup flour or breadcrumbs if needed

## Directions

1. Preheat oven (180°C)
2. Grate your 3 large (or 6 medium) zucchini (unpeeled) and place in a large bowl.
3. Add 1 ½ teaspoons salt to your zucchini and mix well using your hands. Squeeze the zucchini with your hands as you are mixing in the salt to help release the water.
4. Use your cheesecloth (or a clean kitchen towel) to squeeze out as much water as you can from the zucchini. Transfer the drained zucchini to another large bowl. You should end up with approximately 5 cups of drained, shredded zucchini.
5. To your zucchini add the 2 eggs, the 1 cup grated feta, the 1/2 tsp ground black pepper, 1/4 cup vegetable oil, 1/2 cup breadcrumbs, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt and mix to combine.
6. Start shaping the fritters. Take a heaping tablespoon at a time and shape into a flat circle about 1/3 inch thick. The kolokithokeftedes should hold its shape, but it will be wet. If they are too wet and do not hold their shape, add some flour or more breadcrumbs, a little at a time. You may use up to 1/4 cup flour or breadcrumbs.
7. Place your fritters on a parchment lined baking sheet.
8. Bake on bottom rack of your oven until they brown on top and bottom, making sure that they don't burn. This should take between 45-60 minutes.
9. Allow the fritters to cool for 5 minutes on the baking tray before transferring them to a cooling rack or plate. Enjoy!
