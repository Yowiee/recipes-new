## Ingredients

#### For the shakshuka
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 400g leeks, washed and sliced
- 1 tsp salt
- 3 garlic cloves, crushed
- 2 tsp cumin seeds, toasted and ground
- 2 tsp coriander seeds, toasted and ground 
- 50g fresh coriander, chopped
- 30g fresh dill, chopped
- 50g fresh flat leaf parsley
- 5 spring onions, trimmed and thinly sliced
- 250g frozen spinach, defrosted and excess water squeezed out
- ½ tsp ground turmeric
- Ground pepper to season
- 100ml water
- 1 lime, juiced
- 4 small eggs
- 2 tbsp harissa, to serve
- Sesame, toasted, to serve
- Crispy fried garlic, to serve (store bought)
- Additional fresh mint, coriander, dill, flat leaf parsley, to serve

#### For the pide dough
- 1 tsp instant yeast
- ½ tsp caster sugar
- ⅔ cup tepid water
- 2 cups plain flour
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 egg, whisked

## Directions

#### For the pide dough

1. Combine yeast, caster sugar and water in a small jug. Allow to sit for 10 minutes.
2. In a stand mixer bowl place flour, salt, olive oil and yeast mixture. Attach the dough hook and mix. Once the mixture is well combined, knead for a further 5 minutes in the stand mixer. A soft dough will eventually form.
3. Shape into a ball and place in a clean bowl lined with olive oil. Cover with loose cling wrap for approximately 2 hours. The dough will double in size.
4. Deflate the dough by punching it down and then divide into four small balls. Place on a tray with a light covering of flour and once again cover with a loose covering of cling film. Allow to rise for a further hour.

#### For the shakshuka

1. Preheat a shallow frying pan to a warm heat. Add olive oil, leeks, ½ tsp salt and cook, stirring occasionally until softened. 
2. Add garlic, cumin and ground coriander seeds and cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally, then add fresh coriander, dill, parsley and spring onions.
3. Increase heat to medium/high and add spinach. Cook until wilted. Add turmeric, remaining salt and pepper. Add water and cook for 10 minutes or until liquid has fully reduced.
4. Allow to cool slightly.

#### To assemble the pide 

1. Preheat the pizza oven to 300°C.
2. Roll dough into an oval shape on a lightly flour surface. Approximately 25cm long and 15cm wide. Roll a dough docker over the dough to minimise air bubbles while cooking.
3. Using a slotted spoon, top the dough evenly with shakshuka leaving a 3cm gap around the edge.
4. Brush the ends with whisked egg and pinch together. Fold the edges inwards, leaving approximately 10cm of exposed topping.
5. Using pizza lifters, carefully place the filled pide in the preheated pizza oven. After 5 minutes crack an egg on top and cook for a further 5 minutes or until the egg is cooked to your preference.
6. Remove from the pizza oven. Sprinkle with sesame seeds, crispy fried garlic, mint, coriander, dill, flat leaf parsley, salt, pepper and harissa. 

#### Notes
Tip: Pides are delicious with all kinds of fillings including spinach and feta or leftover casseroles and curries.
