## Ingredients

- 1/3 cup soy sauce
- 1/4 cup honey
- 1/4 cup rice vinegar or white vinegar
- 2 Tbsp. tap water
- 1 tsp. light brown sugar
- 1/2 tsp. sesame oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp. minced fresh ginger
- 1/4 - 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes (optional)
- 600 g boneless skinless chicken breasts or thighs

## Directions

1. In a small bowl, whisk together all ingredients until well combined.
2. Add chicken to a large zip-top plastic bag. Pour marinade into the bag and massage into chicken. Allow to sit in the refrigerator for 2 to 24 hours.
3. When ready to cook, preheat oven to 170°C and change over to grill mode, 220°C.
4. Place the chicken close to the grill and grill until it’s browned on top, about 2-3 minutes. Flip the chicken over and grill for another 2 minutes. 
5. Turn off the grill and switch back to oven mode, 170°C, and cook until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the chicken reaches 70°C.
