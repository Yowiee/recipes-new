## Ingredients

- 500g minced lamb, beef, or a mix of both
- 1 onion, peeled and roughly chopped
- 1 cup flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped
- ½ red capsicum, chopped
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon baharat (Lebanese 7 spice)
- ¼ teaspoon white pepper
- Lebanese bread or pita bread, to serve
- Salad, pickles, hummus and yoghurt, to serve

## Directions

1. For the kafta: In a food processor, blend the onion, parsley, and capsicum until finely chopped. This can also be chopped by hand.
2. Transfer the mixture to a sieve over a bowl and press with a spatula to remove most of the excess liquid.
3. In a large bowl, combine the minced meat, strained onion mixture, salt, baharat and white pepper. Mix thoroughly until well incorporated.
4. Cover and refrigerate for at least two hours before using to allow the flavours to combine.
5. To make grilled kafta on pita: Preheat your grill to high.
6. Take a piece of Lebanese bread or large pita bread and thinly spread 100–150g of kafta over one side.
7. Place the bread under the hot grill and cook until the kafta is just done and the edges of the bread are crispy and golden, about 10 minutes. Serve warm with a side of salad, hummus, pickles or tangy yoghurt.
