## Ingredients

- 200g zuchinni, trimmed and coarsely grated
- Salt
- 200g halloumi, coarsely grated
- 200g drained chickpeas (jarred, ideally), mashed with a fork
- 40g plain flour
- 1 egg
- 4-5 tbsp olive oil
- 50g mayonnaise
- 50g greek yoghurt
- Juice of ½ lemon
- 10g chopped dill

## Directions

1. Put the grated zuchinni in a sieve with a pinch of salt, mix, then leave to sit for 10 minutes while you prep the other ingredients. Tip the zuchinni into a tea towel or kitchen roll, then squeeze it out to expel all the excess water.
2. In a large bowl, mix the zuchinni with the halloumi and mashed chickpeas until well incorporated, then stir in the flour and egg to make a thick batter.
3. Put a tablespoon of the oil in a large, nonstick frying pan on a medium heat, then, working in batches, scoop scant tablespoons of the fritter mixture into the hot oil, using a second tablespoon to nudge and shape them into neat rounds. Fry the fritters on a medium heat for two to three minutes on each side, until golden brown and cooked through, then transfer to a tray lined with kitchen paper to drain. Repeat until you’ve used up all the batter (with my largest frying pan, this usually takes four batches).
4. While the fritters are frying, mix the mayonnaise, yoghurt, lemon juice and dill in a small bowl and set aside. If you’re not eating the fritters straight away, leave to cool, then cover and refrigerate, along with the dip, until needed. Warm through in a 180°C (160°C fan) for five minutes, then arrange on a platter and serve with the dip in a nice bowl in the middle.
