## Ingredients

- 250 grams Marie Biscuits (or any other plain, sweet biscuit)
- 125 grams butter
- 125 grams caster sugar (superfine sugar)
- ½ cup walnuts, roughly chopped
- 1 egg, lightly beaten
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 tablespoons cocoa
- 2 tablespoons coconut

#### Icing
- 230 grams chocolate, milk or dark
- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil

## Directions

1. Grease a slice tin and line with baking paper, leaving excess on the sides to lift out slice once set.
2. Crush half of the biscuits in a processor or chopper to reach a fine breadcrumb consistency. Place into a mixing bowl.
3. Break up the other half of the biscuits into small pieces with your hands. Aim for pieces no larger than the size of a postage stamp. Place into the mixing bowl.
4. Place sugar and butter into a medium saucepan and heat gently, stirring, until the butter melts. Increase heat and bring mixture to the boil. Remove from heat and allow to cool for 5-10 minutes.
5. Add the walnuts, vanilla, coconut and cocoa to the saucepan and stir to combine. Add the egg and quickly stir through until combined.
6. Return saucepan to low-medium heat and bring to the boil again. Cook the mixture, stirring, for 3 minutes.
7. Remove from heat and pour the mixture into the mixing bowl with the crushed biscuits.
8. Stir well until mixture is well combined.
9. Pour mixture into slice tin and press into tin evenly using the back of a dessert spoon.
10. Place chocolate and vegetable oil into a microwave-proof bowl and place in microwave for 20 second bursts, stirring between each burst, until chocolate is melted.
11. Pour chocolate over top of slice.
12. Place into fridge to set for at least a few hours.
13. Once set, remove the slice from the tin and cut into squares using a sharp knife.
