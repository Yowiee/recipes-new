## Ingredients

- 450g tin crushed pineapple in natural juice, drained well, liquid reserved
- 1 cup plain flour
- ½ cup self-raising flour
- ½ teaspoon bicarb soda
- ½ teaspoon mixed spice
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 cup dark brown sugar
- ½ cup desiccated coconut

- ¾ cup vegetable oil
- 1 cup mashed banana

#### Icing:
- 60g cream cheese
- 1 teaspoon butter
- Zest of 1 lemon

## Directions

1. Pre-heat oven to 170˚C. Line a 23cm square tin with baking paper.
2. Sift flours, bicarb soda and spices into a large mixing bowl. Add remaining ingredients with ¼ cup of pineapple liquid and stir to mix well. Spoon into prepared tin and bake for about 45-50 minutes or until cake is cooked when tested with a wooden skewer.
3. Remove from the oven and allow to stand in tin for 15 minutes before unmoulding onto a cake rack to cool completely.
4. For the icing: Beat together the cream cheese, butter and lemon zest until light and fluffy. Add sifted icing sugar and beat until smooth. Add a little lemon juice to give spreadable consistency.
5. When the cake is completely cool, spread the icing on top.
