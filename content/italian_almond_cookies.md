## Ingredients

- 1½ cups almond flour
- 2 egg whites, lightly beaten
- 3/4 cup caster sugar *
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 tsp almond extract
- pinch salt
- 1/4 cup powdered sugar

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 180°C. Line a cookies sheet with parchment paper.
2. Add the powdered sugar to a small bowl. Set aside.
3. In a medium bowl, combine your almond flour, egg whites, sugar, vanilla and almond extracts until a cookie dough forms – you may need to use your hands.
4. Scoop out about 1 ½ tbs of dough and roll it into a ball. Dredge the ball in your powdered sugar bowl and then transfer to the cookies sheet. Use your fingers to flatten out the cookie slightly. Bake for 11-13 minutes. These do not spread. Do NOT over bake!
