## Ingredients

- 1 cup (250g) ricotta cheese
- 170 grams dark chocolate good quality ( I use one with 52% cocoa) 
- 3 large eggs (room temperature)
- 1 large egg yolk (room temperature)
- 180 grams granulated sugar
- 120 grams (softened)
- 1 cup (150 g) pastry/cake flour
- 1½ teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 pinch salt

## Directions

1. Pre-heat oven to 180°C (160°C fan). Spray or grease and flour an 8 inch round cake pan or 7 inch bundt pan.
2. In a bowl melt the butter and chocolate either bain marie or microwave, let cool, then pour into the mixing bowl add the sugar and beat, add the eggs and yolk one at a time, mixing well between each addition. Add the ricotta, vanilla and salt beat to combine, sift in the flour and baking powder beat until smooth 2 minutes.
3. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan. Bake for approximately 25-35 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean or with a few crumbs attached. Let cool 20 minutes in the pan then move to a wire rack to cool completely. Dust with powdered sugar before serving. Enjoy!

#### Notes
To make homemade cake/pastry flour for every cup of all purpose flour remove 2 tablespoons and substitute with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch. Sift together to combine well and remove any lumps.
