## Ingredients

- 500g (about 3) zucchini, coarsely grated
- 2 tsp sea salt flakes
- 110g (3/4 cup) plain flour
- 55g (1/2 cup) coarsely grated mozzarella
- 40g (1/2 cup) finely grated parmesan
- 2 garlic cloves, crushed
- 2 tbsp bought basil pesto
- 1 egg
- Tomato pasta sauce, warmed, to serve

## Directions

1. Place zucchini in a colander and sprinkle with salt. Set aside for 10 minutes. Use clean hands to squeeze out excess liquid. Transfer to a large bowl. Add the flour, mozzarella, parmesan, garlic, pesto and egg. Stir until well combined.
2. Line an air fryer basket with baking paper. Working in batches, place tablespoonfuls of mixture on the baking paper, allowing a little room between each spoonful for spreading. Spray with oil. Cook at 180C, turning fritters halfway through cooking, for 15 minutes or until golden and cooked through. Repeat with remaining zucchini mixture.
3. Serve with tomato pasta sauce for dipping.
