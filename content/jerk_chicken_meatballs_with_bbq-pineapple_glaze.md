## Ingredients

#### Meatballs
- Neutral oil
- 0.5 kg ground chicken or turkey
- 1 small yellow or red onion, finely diced
- 1 egg, beaten
- ¼ cup bread crumbs
- 2 Tbs Jamaican jerk seasoning paste, such as Grace or Walkerswood
- 1 Tbs chopped fresh parsley or cilantro leaves
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- ¼ tsp kosher salt
- ¼ tsp black pepper

#### Glaze
- 1 cup pineapple juice
- ½ packed cup light or dark brown sugar
- ¼ cup ketchup
- 2 Tbs Worcestershire sauce
- 1 small garlic clove, minced
- ½ tsp onion powder
- Pinch of red-pepper flakes
- Pinch of kosher salt, plus more to taste
- 1 Tbs cornstarch
- White rice, for serving

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 180°C. Line a sheet pan with aluminum foil and very lightly coat it with oil.
2. Prepare the meatballs: In a medium bowl, combine the chicken, onion, egg, bread crumbs, jerk seasoning paste, parsley, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly to combine, being careful not to overwork the meat. Using lightly wet hands, form the mixture into 12 meatballs, each a bit larger than a golf ball, and space them out on the prepared pan. Bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes. (Alternatively, you can fry them in a nonstick pan coated in oil over medium heat for about 4 to 5 minutes per side.)
3. While the meatballs cook, prepare the glaze: Whisk the pineapple juice, brown sugar, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, onion powder, red-pepper flakes and salt together in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until it reduces enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 10 to 15 minutes.
4. In a small bowl, mix together the cornstarch with 1 tablespoon water. Slowly whisk into the sauce, increase the heat to medium and stir until you reach the desired consistency. (Sauce should look like a thicker gravy.) Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.
5. Add the meatballs to the sauce and stir until coated. Cook over medium-low heat for 2 minutes, until the meatballs are evenly glazed and deepen slightly in color. Serve hot on their own or over rice.
