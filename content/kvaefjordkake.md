## Ingredients

#### cake:
- 150g (1¼ cups) flour
- 1½ tsp baking powder
- 112g (½ cup) lightly salted butter, at room temperature
- 125g (½ cup plus 2 tbsp) granulated sugar
- 4 large egg yolks at room temperature
- 60ml (¼ cup) milk
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

#### meringue:
- 4 large egg whites at room temperature
- 200g (1 cup) granulated sugar
- 50g (½ cup) sliced almonds

#### custard:
- 50g (¼ cup) granulated sugar
- 2 large egg yolks at room temperature
- 2 tbsp cornflour
- 480ml (2 cups) whole milk
- ½ vanilla bean, split lengthwise, or 1 tsp vanilla extract

#### top:
- 300ml (1¼ cups) double cream

## Directions

1. For the cake, preheat the oven to 165°C. Butter a 40 x 30 cm (16 x 12 inch) rimmed baking sheet and line it with baking paper (parchment), pressing down so the paper sticks to the baking sheet.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour and baking powder.
3. Fit a stand mixer with a paddle attachment and beat the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the egg yolks, 1 at a time, beating until incorporated. Add the milk and vanilla and beat until blended. Add the flour mixture, beating until incorporated; the batter should be somewhat thick and sticky. Using a rubber spatula, carefully spread the batter evenly across the prepared baking sheet, going as far to the edges as possible, while maintaining a rectangular shape.
4. For the meringue, in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the egg whites on medium until foamy. Gradually add the sugar, whipping until glossy stiff peaks form. Pour the meringue over the batter on the baking sheet and use a spatula to spread it evenly, lifting upwards to form little peaks. Sprinkle the sliced almonds on top. Bake for about 30 minutes, or until the meringue is dry and lightly golden. Set aside to cool.
5. For the custard, in a large bowl, whisk together the sugar and egg yolks. Add the cornflour and whisk until thick and pale yellow.
6. Put the milk in a small saucepan. Scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean into the milk and add the scraped bean (or add the vanilla extract). Warm over medium heat until just beginning to simmer then remove from the heat. Remove the vanilla bean, then slowly add the milk to the egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly to avoid curdling the eggs. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and place over medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until thick. Set aside to cool.
7. For the whipped cream, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Fold into the cooled custard.
8To assemble, use the paper to lift the cake out of the baking sheet and place, meringue side up, on a large cutting board with the long sides horizontal. Cut the cake vertically in half so that you have two equal size cakes. Carefully hold a large serving tray with one hand over the top of one of the cakes. Place the other hand under the cake, and flip it over onto the serving tray, so the meringue side is facing down on the tray. Peel away the paper. Spread the custard cream over the cake on the serving tray. Peel away the paper from the other cake and gently place it, meringue side up, on top of the custard cream to form one cake. Chill in the refrigerator for an hour or so before serving. Keep covered in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days.
