## Ingredients

- 3 tbsp vegetable oil
- 3 cardamom pods
- 3 cloves
- 1 brown onion, finely chopped
- 4 garlic cloves, roughly chopped
- 2 cm x 3 cm piece ginger, peeled, finely chopped
- Â¼ cup (60 ml) passata
- 1 tsp turmeric powder
- 1 tsp chilli powder
- 500 g lamb mince (or beef)
- 1 tsp sugar
- 2 tbsp dried fenugreek leaves (optional)
- 15 g butter
- 2 tsp garam masala
- 2 tbsp roughly chopped coriander
- Salt and black pepper
- Lemon wedges, red onion rings, paratha or rice, to serve

## Directions

1. Heat the oil, cardamom and cloves in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Cook for about 30 seconds until fragrant, then add the onion and fry for a few minutes further. Add the garlic and ginger and fry for another few minutes until fragrant, then add the passata, then cook, until slightly thickened.
2. Add the turmeric and chilli powder and mix well to combine. Add the mince and fry, breaking up with a wooden spoon, until browned. Add the sugar, fenugreek leaves (if using) and about 1 cup of water. Cover, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes, adding more water if needed.
3. Mix through the butter and garam masala, followed by the coriander. Season to taste with salt, pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice, to taste. Transfer the lamb kheema to a large serving bowl. Top with the onion rings and serve with the remaining lemon wedges and rice or paratha on the side.
