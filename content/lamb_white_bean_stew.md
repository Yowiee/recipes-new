## Ingredients

- 2 cans white beans, such as butter or cannellini beans
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 brown onion, diced
- 7 cloves garlic, crushed
- ½ cup fresh coriander leaves, chopped
- 350g diced lamb leg (see tips above for alternatives)
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 400g diced tomatoes, canned
- 1 litre vegetable stock
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1½ teaspoons Baharat, often sold as Lebanese 7 Spice (see tips above for where to find it)
- Pepper, to taste
- Rice, to serve (traditional vermicelli rice or white rice)

## Directions

1. Begin this dish the night before you plan to eat it by placing the beans and baking soda in a large bowl and covering with plenty of water. Baking soda helps the beans break down, reducing cooking time. Leave to soak overnight.
2. The following day, drain the water and rinse the beans. Set aside.
3. Heat the oil in the slow cooker using the sauté function (this part can also be done in a fry pan then transferred back to the slow cooker). Add the diced onion and sauté until soft and translucent.
4. Add garlic and coriander and fry for about 2 minutes until fragrant.
5. Place the lamb pieces into the pot and cook for about 5 minutes. The goal is to brown the meat and create a seal, rather than fully cook it.
6. Now add the tomato paste, diced tomatoes, stock, beans and seasonings. Stir the mixture thoroughly to ensure everything is well combined.
7. Place lid on your slow cooker and cook on high for 4 hours.
8. After 4 hours, remove lid and check if beans are ready. They should mash quite easily when pressed between two fingers. If they do not, put slow cooker lid back on and cook for another hour.
9. Serve stew warm on a bed of rice.
