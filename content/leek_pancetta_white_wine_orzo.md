## Ingredients

- 90g smoked pancetta, finely sliced
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 500g leeks, washed, trimmed and finely sliced
- 2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced
- 1 large knob unsalted butter
- Sea salt and black pepper
- 12g fresh thyme sprigs
- 150ml white wine
- 300g orzo
- 1 litre chicken stock
- ½ lemon
- 60g pecorino, finely grated
- 1 handful flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped

## Directions

1. Put the pancetta and oil in a deep, wide frying pan or large saucepan, set it over a medium heat and fry for three or four minutes, until the pancetta is crisp.
2. Add the leeks, sliced garlic and butter to the pan, season generously, then pick in the thyme leaves and cook, stirring often, for five minutes. Add the wine, turn up the heat and stir until most of the liquid evaporates.
3. Add the orzo, stir for a few minutes until it’s all coated in the buttery leeks, then pour in the stock and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to low, cover the pan and leave to simmer for 10 minutes, stirring once or twice. Take off the heat, squeeze in the lemon juice, then stir in most of the grated pecorino.
4. Leave, still covered, for a minute, then serve sprinkled with the parsley, remaining pecorino and some extra grinds of black pepper.
