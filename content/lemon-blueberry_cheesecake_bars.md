## Ingredients

- 1 ½ packets bicuits (Mariee or Digestives)
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter (1/2 stick), melted
- 250g cream cheese, at room temperature
- ¼ cup granulated sugar
- ¼ cup sour cream or plain strained yogurt, such as Greek-style
- 1 large egg
- Zest of 1 large lemon
- 3 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Pinch of salt
- 1 ½ cups blueberries

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 160C. Coat an 8-inch-square baking pan with cooking spray.
2. Process graham crackers in a food processor until fine crumbs form. Drizzle with butter and pulse until the crumbs are coated. Transfer to the prepared pan and press the mixture firmly and evenly into the bottom of the pan. Bake until lightly browned around the edges, about 10 minutes. Let cool in the pan on a wire rack for at least 10 minutes. (Leave the oven on.)
3. Meanwhile, wipe out the food processor bowl. Place softened cream cheese, sugar, sour cream (or yogurt), egg, lemon zest, lemon juice, vanilla and salt in the food processor bowl. Process until smooth. Transfer to a medium bowl; stir in blueberries.
4. Pour the filling evenly over the baked crust. Bake until the center appears just set, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool to room temperature then cover and refrigerate until cold, about 4 hours more.
