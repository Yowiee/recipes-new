## Ingredients

- 125g butter, melted
- ½ cup (75g) caster sugar
- ½ cup milk
- 2 eggs, lightly beaten
- 1 cup (150g) self-raising flour
- 1 cup (85g) desiccated coconut
- Finely grated zest of 1 lemon

#### Icing:
- 1 tablespoon butter, softened
- 2 cups icing sugar
- Juice of ½ lemon

## Directions

1. Pre-heat oven to 160ºC.  
2. Line a 20cm square cake tin with baking paper.
3. Place the ingredients into a bowl and stir gently with a whisk or large spoon.  
4. Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and bake for about 25 minutes or until lightly coloured on top and cake is cooked when tested with a skewer.
5. Remove from the oven and leave in the tin for 15 minutes, then turn out onto a wire cooling rack and leave to cool completely.

#### For the icing:
1. Combine the butter and icing sugar in a food processor or stir in a mixing bowl with a large spoon. 
2. Add the lemon juice, a teaspoon at a time, until it is of spreading consistency.
3. Place the cooled cake on a serving plate and top with the icing, spreading with an offset spatula until smooth.  
4. Set aside for the icing to set.  
5. Cut into squares or fingers.
