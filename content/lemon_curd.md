#### How do I sterilise jars for my lemon curd?
It’s important to sterilise your jars to prevent mold from forming. There are a few ways you can do this. Use jars that have tight-fitting lids, and wash them in hot soapy water. The most common way to sterilise jars is in the oven. Simply preheat the oven to 120°C, place the jars and lids on the oven racks and heat for 20 minutes. Remove and fill immediately with the curd. Another way is to place the jars and their lids in a saucepan. Cover with cold water and bring to the boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer for 10 minutes. Use metal tongs to transfer to a clean tea towel and set aside to dry.
