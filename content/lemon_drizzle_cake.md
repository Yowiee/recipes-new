## Ingredients

#### Cake:
- ¾ cup grapeseed or vegetable oil
- 3 free-range eggs
- 1 tbsp finely grated lemon rind
- ¼ cup lemon juice
- 1 cup plain thick yoghurt
- 2½ cups flour
- 3 tsp baking powder
- 1½ cups caster sugar

#### Lemon drizzle icing
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup lemon juice

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 160C. Grease a 2.5-litre-capacity bundt tin with butter and refrigerate until the butter is set.
2. Place the oil, eggs, lemon rind, lemon juice and yoghurt in a bowl and whisk to combine.
3. Sift the flour and baking powder into a separate large bowl. Add the caster sugar and mix to combine. Make a well in the centre and add the egg mixture. Whisk to combine.
4. Pour into the prepared tin and bake for 45-50 minutes or until cooked when tested with a skewer. Allow to stand for 10 minutes, then invert onto a wire rack and allow to stand for a further 10 minutes. Gently remove from the tin.
5. Lemon drizzle icing: Gently stir the sugar and lemon juice together. While the cake is still hot, place on a cake stand or serving plate and spoon over the lemon drizzle icing. Allow to set for 10 minutes before serving.
