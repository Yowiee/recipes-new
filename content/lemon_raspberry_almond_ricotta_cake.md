## Ingredients

- 125g unsalted butter, softened
- 1 cup (200g) caster (superfine) sugar
- 2 Tbsp finely grated lemon rind
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 4 large eggs, separated
- 2 cups (190g) almond meal (ground almonds)
- 1 cup fresh ricotta
- 125g raspberries
- ½ cup (50g) flaked almonds
- Thick or double (thick) cream (optional), to serve


## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 160°C. Line a 20cm (8 in) round cake tin with non-stick baking paper.
2. Place the butter and ⅔ cup (150g) of the sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer and beat for 4 minutes or until light and creamy. Add the lemon rind and vanilla and beat until combined.
3. Add the egg yolks, one at a time, beating well between each addition.
4. Fold through the almond meal and ricotta.
5. In a clean bowl of an electric mixer, whisk the egg whites until soft peaks form. Add the remaining sugar and whisk until stiff peaks form.
6. Fold a spoonful of whipped egg white into the almond mixture, then gently fold in the remaining egg white until combined.
7. Spoon the mixture into the prepared tin and sprinkle with raspberries and almonds. Bake for 1 hour or until firm and golden around the edges but with a slight jiggle in the middle. Allow the cake to cool completely in the tin.
8. To serve, place on a cake stand or serving plate. Serve with cream, if desired.
