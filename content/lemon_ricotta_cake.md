## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups (174g) ‘00’ Pizza Flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp table salt
- 115g unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 200g granulated sugar
- zest of 1 lemon
- 3 large eggs, separated
- 225g ricotta cheese, whole preferred
- 1 1/2 tsp vanilla bean paste

#### Glaze
- 2 tablespoons (30g) lemon juice
- 3 tablespoons (45g) coarse sparkling sugar
- 1/2 cup (60g) confectioners' sugar

## Directions

1 . Preheat the oven to 180°C fan with a rack in the center. Line the bottom of an 20cm cake pan with parchment and grease the bottom and sides. 
2 . In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. 
3 . In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the flat beater or working with an electric hand mixer, beat together the butter, sugar, and lemon zest on medium speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. 
4 . Scrape down the bowl, add the egg yolks, and beat until combined, about 1 minute. Add the ricotta, extracts, and dry ingredients and beat on low until no dry streaks remain. 
5 . In a medium bowl, whisk the whites until very frothy, 1 to 2 minutes (no need to reach soft peaks).  
6 . Scrape down the sides of the bowl with the batter and pour in the egg whites. Mix on medium speed, scraping down the sides as needed, until the batter becomes smooth (it will be quite gloppy at first). Finish mixing by hand to make sure everything is incorporated. 
7 . Transfer the thick batter to the prepared pan and smooth it into an even layer. (A small offset spatula is a helpful tool here.) 
8 . Bake the lemon ricotta cake for 20 to 25 minutes, until deeply golden, then tent with foil and bake for 8 to 10 minutes. The cake is done when it’s set, has pulled away from the sides of the pan slightly, and springs back when lightly pressed. 
9 . Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. 
10. To make the glaze: In a small bowl or liquid measuring cup, whisk together the lemon juice and sugars until no dry confectioners’ sugar remains. 
11. Turn out the lemon ricotta cake onto a wire rack and set the rack atop a plate or parchment-lined baking sheet. Pour the glaze evenly over the top of the cake, encouraging it to reach all the way to the edges.  
12. Let the lemon ricotta cake cool until the glaze is set, about 30 minutes. Serve it slightly warm or at room temperature, with macerated fruit if desired.
