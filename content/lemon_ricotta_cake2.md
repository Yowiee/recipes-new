## Ingredients

- 2 cups (240g) all purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 cup (113g) unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for greasing the pan
- 1/4 cup (55g) extra virgin olive oil
- 1 1/2 cups (300g) granulated sugar
- 2 lemons, zested and juiced to make 1/4 cup lemon juice
- 3 large eggs, at room temperature
- 1 1/2 cup (340g) ricotta cheese, at room temperature
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Powdered sugar, for serving


## Directions

1. Get ready: Preheat the oven to 160Â°C. Liberally grease the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan with butter. Line the bottom of the pan with a round of parchment paper and grease the parchment paper.
2. Combine the dry ingredients: In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
3. Beat the butter and sugar: Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or a large mixing bowl with a hand mixer, beat the butter, olive oil, sugar, and lemon zest on medium speed until light and creamy, about 3 minutes.
4. Add the eggs: Add the eggs to the creamed butter, one at a time, beating well and scraping the bowl with a silicone spatula between each addition.
5. Incorporate the ricotta cheese: Add the ricotta cheese and mix on low speed until fully combined.
6. Alternate adding the flour and lemon juice: Use a silicone spatula to fold in half of the dry ingredients to the ricotta mixture. Pour in the lemon juice and vanilla extract and gently stir to incorporate, making sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl. Add in the remaining dry ingredients, mixing with the spatula just until combined.
7. Bake: Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake for 50 to 55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.
8. Cool: Let the cake cool in the pan on a wire rack for 20 minutes. Run a butter knife around the edges of the cake. Release the spring and remove the outer ring, then transfer the cake onto a wire rack, peel off the parchment paper, and allow it to cool completely, about 1 hour.
9. Serve: Dust the top of the cake with powdered sugar. Slice and serve.
