## Ingredients

- 2 x 250g packages cream cheese, softened

- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- 115g butter, melted and cooled
- 3 tablespoons flour
- 3 tablespoons cornstarch
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 170°C. Lightly grease a 9-inch springform pan.
2. Mix cream cheese and ricotta cheese together in a mixing bowl until well combined. Add eggs, sugar, butter, flour, cornstarch, lemon juice, and vanilla; mix to combine. Stir in sour cream and pour into the prepared pan.
