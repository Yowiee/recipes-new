## Ingredients

- 125g butter, at room temperature, chopped
- 155g (3/4 cup) caster sugar
- 1 lemon, rind finely grated
- 250g fresh ricotta (see note)
- 3 eggs
- 150g (1 cup) self-raising flour
- 60ml (1/4 cup) fresh lemon juice
- 100g (1/4 cup) lemon curd, plus extra to serve
- Pure icing sugar, to dust
- Vanilla ice cream, to serve

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 170C/150C fan forced. Grease and line the base of a 20cm springform cake pan with baking paper.
2. Use electric beaters to beat the butter, sugar and lemon rind until pale and creamy. Add the ricotta and beat until just combined. One at a time add the eggs, beating well after each addition.
3. Use a large metal spoon to fold the flour into the mixture. Stir in the lemon juice. Transfer mixture to the prepared pan and dollop with 100g (1/4 cup) lemon curd. Use a flat bladed knife to swirl the lemon curd into the batter. Gently tap the pan on the bench to settle the batter. Bake for 45 minutes or until the cake springs back when lightly touched (see note).
4. Cool the cake in the pan for 10 minutes, then release the side of the pan. Cut the cake into wedges and serve warm, dust with icing sugar, drizzled with extra curd and topped with ice cream.

#### Notes

* If you can, use ricotta bought from the deli as it tends to be firmer and less watery. If you are using ricotta from the supermarket, place it on paper towel on a plate to drain for a few minutes, then weigh it.
* When you test the cake, try and avoid the lemon swirls on the top. Placing the skewer in these parts can give you a wetter outcome due to the lemon curd but the rest of the cake is cooked and perfect. You then run the risk of overcooking.
* To serve the cake cold, remove sides as directed then leave to cool until firm and just warm. Use baking paper to lift the cake off pan and place onto a wire rack. Carefully slide the paper out and leave to cool completely. Use fresh ricotta from the deli section of the supermarket.
