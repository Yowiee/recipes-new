## Ingredients

- 1½ cups brown lentils
- 5 cups vegetable stock (or water), divided
- 1½ teaspoons salt
- ½ teaspoon Lebanese Baharat, a blend of spices sometimes known as seven spices found at a Middle Eastern grocer
- 3 brown onions
- ⅓ cup olive oil
- ⅓ cup vegetable oil
- 1 cup rice, washed

## Directions

1. Sift through the lentils and discard any small rocks or debris. Then rinse the lentils in a fine mesh sieve.
2. Place lentils in a large pot with 4 cups of stock (or water), salt, and baharat. Bring this to the boil, reduce heat and allow to simmer for 15 minutes.
3. In the meantime, finely slice the onions.
4. Place the onions in a frypan with both oils and cook on a low heat for about 10 minutes or until they are caramelised and golden brown.
5. After the lentils have simmered for 15 minutes, add the rice, the caramelised onions, plus the one remaining cup of stock (or water) to the lentils.
6. There should be enough liquid to cover the lentils and rice. If not, add a little more water. Cover the pot with a lid and leave to simmer on low heat for another 11 minutes until the rice is cooked. Turn off heat and leave the lid on the pot and allow the steam to finish cooking the rice.
7. Fluff up the lentils and rice using a fork before serving with a dollop of yoghurt and salad on the side. This dish can be served warm or cold.
