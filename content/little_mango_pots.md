## Ingredients

- 300ml mango pulp or puree
- 300ml double cream
- 50g golden caster sugar
- Juice of 2 medium lemons
- Biscuits, to serve

## Directions

1. Put the mango, double cream and sugar in a medium saucepan, and give it all a good mix. Put the pan on a medium heat and slowly bring the mixture to a boil. The moment it starts to boil, whisk in the lemon juice, boil for 30 seconds more, then take off the heat.
2. Pour the mango mix into six glasses, chill for at least three hours, or until set, then serve.
