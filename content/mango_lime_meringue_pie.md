## Ingredients

#### PASTRY
- 2 1/4 cups (335g) plain flour
- 185g chilled unsalted butter, chopped
- 1/4 cup (60ml) iced water

#### MANGO AND LIME FILLING
- 525g peeled mango flesh, roughly chopped (from 3 large mangoes, or use thawed frozen fruit)
- 2 tsp finely grated lime zest
- 1/3 cup (80ml) lime juice
- 4 large egg yolks, at room temperature
- 1/2 cup (110g) caster sugar
- 80g chilled unsalted butter, chopped
- 4 (7g) platinum-strength gelatine leaves (we used McKenzies)

#### MERINGUE
- 1 cup (220g) caster sugar
- 4 large egg whites, at room temperature

## Directions

1. Place the flour and butter in the bowl a food processor and whiz until it resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add the water and pulse again until it starts to clump together, adding an additional 1 tbs if needed. Don’t overprocess or the pastry will be tough. Bring together with your hands to form a smooth ball, then roll out between baking paper to a 4mm thick round. Carefully transfer to a 23cm (base measurement), 25cm (top measurement), 3cm deep fluted tart pan with removable base, pressing gently into base and side of pan. Trim the overhang to sit upright 2cm above the pans edge. Chill for 1 hour to set firm.
2. Preheat oven to 200C/180C fan-forced.
3. Prick the base of the chilled pastry all over using a fork, then line with baking paper and fill with pastry weights or uncooked rice or beans. Blind bake for 25 minutes or until almost cooked through and light golden. Remove the paper and weights and bake for 10 minutes, then use a small serrated knife to trim the overhanging pastry edge. Bake for 5-10 minutes or until deep golden and pastry is completely cooked. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
4. For the filling, place mango, zest and juice in a small food processor and whizz to a smooth puree. Transfer to a small saucepan, add yolks and sugar and place over a medium-low heat. Cook, whisking constantly, for 5-8 minutes or until sugar dissolves and mixture thickens, but don’t let it boil. Whisk in the butter, a few pieces at a time until melted, well combined and smooth.
Me anwhile, soak the gelatine in a small bowl of cold water for 5 minutes until soft. Squeeze out the excess water and add to mango mixture in pan and reduce heat to low. Cook, stirring constantly, until gelatine melts and mixture is completely smooth. Pour into the pastry shell and level surface. Chill for 1 hour or until set.
6. For the meringue, place the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and whisk on medium-high speed until soft peaks form.
7. Place the sugar and 1/2 cup (125ml) cold water in a small pan over low heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until the sugar dissolves. Increase temperature to high and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce heat to medium for an even simmer and cook, untouched, until the syrup reaches 118-120°C on a candy thermometer.
8. With the motor running on medium, slowly pour the hot syrup onto the egg whites in the mixer bowl until combined. Increase speed to medium-high and whisk for 5 minutes or until very thick, firm glossy peaks form.
9. Spoon the meringue over the mango filling, using the back of the spoon to smooth to the edges of the filling and swirling to create small peaks. Use a kitchen blowtorch to toast the meringue all over until light golden.
