## Ingredients

- 48 salada crackers
- 1 cup (227 g) unsalted butter
- ¾ cup (150 g) light brown sugar, packed
- ¼ cup (80 g) pure maple syrup
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon maple extract
- 1 cup (182 g) semi-sweet chocolate chips
- 1 cup (109 g) pecans, chopped

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 220°C. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Arrange the crackers, salted side down, in a single layer on the lined baking sheet. Set aside.
3. To a small saucepan over medium-high heat, add the butter, brown sugar, maple syrup, and salt. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring often.
4. Allow the mixture to boil for 3-5 minutes, or until the butter is completely melted, the sugar has dissolved, and the mixture reaches a temperature of 130°C to 140°C on a candy thermometer. It should darken in color and thicken slightly.
5. Remove from the heat. Stir in the baking soda and maple extract. Carefully pour the mixture evenly over the crackers, spreading it to the edges.
6. Bake for 3-5 minutes, or until the butter and sugar mixture begins to bubble.
7. Carefully remove the pan from the oven. Immediately sprinkle the chocolate chips on top of the crackers. Allow the chocolate chips to sit for about one minute, or until they start to soften and melt.
8. Using an offset spatula, carefully spread the melted chocolate over the crackers. Then, evenly sprinkle with pecans.
9. Transfer the pan to the refrigerator for about an hour, or until the mixture is set. Alternatively, you can place it in the freezer for quicker setting, for about 30 minutes.
10. Once set, break into small, uneven pieces by hand.
