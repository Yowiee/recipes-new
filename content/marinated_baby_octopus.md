## Ingredients

- 2 kg / 4 lb baby octopus , rinsed (Note 1)

#### Braising liquid:
- 4 litres / quarts water
- 1 onion , halved, skin on
- 6 garlic cloves , smashed (Note 2)
- 1 tsp black peppercorns (sub 1/2 tsp ground pepper)
- 2 tsp cooking salt (kosher salt)
- 3 tbsp lemon juice (or apple cider vinegar)
- 3 parsley stems (with leaves)
- 2 bay leaves , fresh or dried

#### Marinade:
- 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 6 garlic cloves , very finely minced (or use garlic press)
- 2 tsp lemon zest (one large lemon)
- 2 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tsp dried red chilli flakes (red pepper flakes), optional
- 1/2 tsp each cooking/kosher salt and black pepper

#### Cooking & serving:
- 1 tbsp canola oil (for BBQ or large skillet)
- 2 tsp parsley , finely chopped (optional)
- 1 large red chilli , finely sliced (optional)
- Lemon wedges (highly recommended)

## Directions

1. Braising – Put all the braising liquid ingredients in a large pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Add octopus, bring back up to the boil, then reduce the heat to low so the water is simmering very, very gently. Scoop off and discard scum off the surface when it accumulates.
2. Braise 1 hour until tender, first checking at the 45 minute mark, or until octopus is tender (take a little nibble to check!).
3. Drain octopus in a colander. Pick out and discard the bay leaves, onion etc. Transfer octopus into a bowl.
4. Marinate – Mix marinade ingredients in a bowl. Pour over the octopus (while still hot). Toss, allow to fully cool, cover with cling wrap then marinate overnight in the fridge. (Note 4)
5. Cook until crispy (BBQ) – Heat a BBQ hot plate on medium high until hot. Spread oil across the hot plate. Use tongs to transfer the octopus onto the BBQ (leave residual oil behind), spread out and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, rotating as needed to brown all over, and most especially ensuring the legs are golden and crispy. (Stove – use a large skillet, cook in 2 or 3 batches).
6. Serve – Pile octopus on a plate. Sprinkle with parsley and chilli, add lemon wedges. EAT and be happy! Serve with bread for mopping or see Note 4 for crushed potatoes pictured in post dressed with residual marinade.

#### Notes:

1. Baby octopus is sold fresh and frozen. I buy mine frozen in 2 kg / 4 lb blocks at my local seafood shop. Thaw, drain well, then use per recipe. No need to peel the skin, it’s cooked until tender. You won’t even notice the skin.
Tenderness – easy to tell when it’s ready, it should be tender but not overcooked so it gets mushy. Start checking at 45 minutes. Mine are usually done in 1 hour, for slightly larger ones it might take 70 minutes.
Large octopus legs – Keep whole and follow recipe as written. They should take around the same time to become tender even though they are thicker.
Fresh octopus can take a little longer than frozen as freezing kick-starts the tenderising process.
2. Smashed garlic cloves – leave the skin on. Place the side of a chef’s knife on the garlic then bang with the palm of your hand to make the garlic burst open but mostly hold together. Garlic flavour will infuse into the braising liquid but it’s easy to pick out later.
3. Marinating – Don’t shortcut this. Minimum 12 hours, 24 hours is best for maximum flavour infusion!
4. Crushed potatoes – I boiled 500g baby potatoes with the octopus for the last 30 minutes. Lightly crushed them and poured over the residual marinade after removing the octopus to cook it (it’s flavour loaded, don’t waste it!!)
5. Leftovers will keep for 2 – 3 days in the fridge. I swear it’s even better the next day! I have also been known to intentionally make ahead and to make another batch of marinade (no salt) and put the BBQ’d octopus into the marinade. Then you have a simple marinated octopus situation and it is a ridiculously delicious flavour bomb that’s the perfection addition to a cold seafood platter or a grazing board, or a simple summer lunch.
