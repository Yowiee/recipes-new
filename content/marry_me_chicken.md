## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 20g butter
- 4 small Coles RSPCA Approved Chicken Breasts Fillets
- 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 2 tbsp heaped sun-dried tomato pesto
- 250ml (1 cup) thickened cream
- 125ml (1/2 cup) liquid chicken stock
- 80g (1/4 cup) sun-dried tomato strips, drained
- 60g pkt baby spinach
- Fresh basil leaves, torn, to serve
- Shredded parmesan, to serve
- Crusty bread, to serve

## Directions

1. Heat the oil and butter in a large non-stick frying pan over high heat until the butter foams. Season the chicken and add to the pan. Reduce heat to medium-high and cook, for 5 minutes each side, until golden. Transfer to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm.
2. Add the garlic and pesto to the pan. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute or until aromatic. Add the cream, stock and sun-dried tomato strips. Rapidly simmer, stirring occasionally, for 5-8 minutes or until sauce is slightly thickened.
3. Return chicken to the pan and simmer, turning halfway through cooking, for 5-8 minutes or until liquid is reduced and the chicken is cooked through. Stir through the spinach until just wilted. Season and sprinkle with the basil leaves and parmesan. Serve with crusty bread.
