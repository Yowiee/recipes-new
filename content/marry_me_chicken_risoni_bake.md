## Ingredients

- 135g tub semi-dried tomatoes, drained, oil reserved
- 4 garlic cloves, sliced
- 305g (1 1/2 cups) dried risoni
- 1 1/2 tsp dried thyme
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 500ml (2 cups) chicken stock
- 300ml light thickened cream for cooking
- 180ml (3/4 cup) water
- 2 cups shredded cooked chicken
- 80g baby spinach leaves
- 100g (1 cup) pre-grated mozzarella

## Directions

1: Heat reserved tomato oil in a large, deep, ovenproof frying pan over medium-high heat. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute or until aromatic. Add risoni, thyme, tomato paste, stock, cream and the water. Bring to a simmer. Season with salt & pepper.
2: Reduce heat to medium and simmer, covered, for 12-13 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until risoni is al dente. Stir in chicken, spinach and semi-dried tomatoes.
3: Preheat an oven grill to high. Sprinkle risoni mixture with the cheese and grill for 1 minute or until cheese is golden. Serve. Watch our step-by-step video below to see how to make our ‘Marry me’ chicken risoni bake recipe.

#### Notes:
1. Substituted the cream for a tin of evaporated milk and reduced the water accordingly.
