## Ingredients

- 1 1/3 cup (220 grams) dark chocolate, finely chopped
- 2/3 cup + 2 tablespoon (180 grams) unsalted butter, cubed
- 4 large eggs
- 4 large egg yolks
- 1/2 cup (100 grams) caster sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon of salt
- 5 tablespoons (50 grams) plain flour
- Dutch processed cocoa powder, for coating and finishing

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 230Â°C.
2. Lightly butter 2 x 200ml-capacity ramekins (see tips above if you don't own ramekins), then dust the inside with a little cocoa powder, shaking it around, and tapping out the excess.
3. Put the chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl, then set it over a saucepan filled with a few centimetres of barely simmering water. Do not let the base of the bowl touch the water below. Heat, stirring over medium-low, until melted. Set aside.
4. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, or, using an electric whisk, whisk the eggs, yolks, sugar, and salt, until pale, thick, and almost doubled in volume, about 5 minutes. Turn the speed to low, then stream in the melted chocolate mixture, slowly, until it is all used up. Sift over the flour and fold it in with a large rubber spatula.
5. Pour into the prepared ramekins, filling them no more than two-thirds full.
6. Bake, until domed and just firm to the touch, about 8 to 12 minutes. Let stand for less than a minute, then carefully turn the fondants out and onto a plate, for serving.
7. Dust with cocoa powder, then serve soon after, hot, with ice-cream.
