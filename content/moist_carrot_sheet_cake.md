## Ingredients

#### Carrot Cake
- 2 cups (225 g) finely grated carrots - about 3 medium sized carrots
- 1 cup (190 g) canned pineapple - blended. Remove the liquid from the can before blending. Use canned pineapple in juice (not syrup).
- 2¼ cups (290 g) flour - plain, all purpose
- ¼ cup (30 g) cornstarch
- 2 tsp baking powder
- ½ tsp baking soda
- ½ tsp salt
- 2½ tsp cinnamon - ground
- 1¾ tsp ginger - ground/powdered
- ¼ tsp cloves - ground
- ½ tsp nutmeg - ground
- 1½ cups (300 g) soft brown sugar - firmly packed (see note 2)
- 3 large eggs - room temperature
- 1 cup (200 g) unflavoured vegetable oil - I use canola oil
- 3 tsp vanilla essence/extract
- ½ cup (110 g) yoghurt - unsweetened, room temperature.
- 1 cup (100 g) pecans or walnuts - coarsely chopped. I like to use both so I use 1/2 a cup of each.

#### Cream Cheese Frosting
- ½ cup (113 g) unsalted butter - room temperature
- 2¼ cups (285 g) powdered sugar - also known as icing/confectioners sugar
- ¾ cup (167 g) cream cheese - cold, use a firm cream cheese
- ¾ tsp vanilla extract/essence
- ¾ tbsp lemon juice - freshly squeezed

## Directions

#### Carrot Cake
1. Preheat oven to 180°C (160°C fan) and lightly grease a 9x13 inch cake pan. Line the bottom long ways with parchment paper (this will make it easier to take the cake out when it's done).
2. Begin by peeling and finely grating your carrots and set them aside for later. Also prepare your pineapple - blend your canned pineapple (remember to discard the liquid before blending - see note 3) and set aside for later.
3. In a bowl, sift together flour, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and nutmeg. Using a whisk, mix until well combined. Set aside.
4. In a large mixing bowl combine soft brown sugar, eggs, vegetable oil, vanilla, yoghurt and blended pineapple. Using a whisk, mix until well combined.
5. Add your dry ingredients into your wet mixture and using a spatula, gently fold together until just combined. Do not overmix.
6. Add in the grated carrots and walnuts and/or pecans. Using a spatula, gently fold until just combined. Do not overmix.
7. Distribute the batter evenly into the cake tin, and then drop the cake tin lightly on the counter to remove any large air bubbles.
8. Bake for 28 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool in the cake tin for about 20 minutes and then turn it out onto a wire rack to completely cool, before frosting with the cream cheese frosting (recipe below).

#### Cream Cheese Frosting
1. Cream your butter for a few minutes until it's light and fluffy. Either use a hand mixer or stand mixer on a medium high speed. If using a stand mixer, use the paddle attachment.
2. Add in the powdered sugar in 3 batches while mixing on low. Ensure that each batch is mixed into the butter well before adding in the next.
3. Next add in the cold cream cheese, vanilla and fresh lemon juice. Mix just until the frosting is smooth. Avoid over-mixing.
