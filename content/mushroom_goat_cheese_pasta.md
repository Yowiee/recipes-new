## Ingredients

- 240g mushrooms
- 3 medium shallots
- 3 large garlic cloves
- 1/4 cup fresh sage leaves
- 3 sprigs fresh rosemary stems removed
- 7-8 sprigs fresh thyme stems removed, plus extra for garnish
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
- Extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons salted butter
- 180g ounces pasta shape of choice
- 180g crumbled goat cheese

## Directions

1. Remove the stem from the mushrooms and thinly slice them. Add them to a large bowl.
2. Thinly sliced the shallots and garlic and add to the bowl. Tear in the sage leaves, rosemary and thyme. Drizzle the bowl with the Worcestershire sauce and vinegar and give a big mix.
3. Set a large saut√© pan over medium heat. Add enough olive oil to coat the bottom of the pan, one large glug. Add the butter and let it fully melt into the oil.
4. Pour in the mushroom mixture. Cook this over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 25-35 minutes, or until the mushrooms are deeply brown and the shallots are nearly caramelized.
5. During the end of this time, bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt it liberally. Cook the pasta until al dente, about 6-7 minutes.
6. When the pasta is two minutes away from being finished, stir the goat cheese into the mushrooms. Reduce the heat to low and stir until a creamy sauce forms.
7. When the pasta is finished, use a slotted spoon to transfer it to the pan with the mushrooms. Add a splash of pasta water and stir to create a glossy, saucy pasta. Add more pasta water as needed. Taste and season with more salt and pepper as preferred.
8. Scoop the pasta onto a plate and garnish with more fresh thyme to serve.
