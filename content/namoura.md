## Ingredients

#### Syrup
- 2 cups / 400 grams granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 1¼ teaspoons lavender extract, vanilla extract or rose water

#### Cake
- ¾ cup / 170 grams unsalted butter, melted, plus more for coating the pan
- 3 cups / 490 grams semolina flour
- ¾ cup / 150 grams granulated sugar
- 1 cup / 227 grams plain whole-milk yogurt
- 2½ teaspoons baking soda
- ¼ cup / 30 grams slivered almonds
	
## Directions

1. In a small saucepan over high heat, boil sugar and 1 cup/240 milliliters of water, stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Reduce the heat to a simmer, add lemon juice and extract, and stir to combine. Simmer until thickened into a syrup, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool.
2. Heat oven to 200°C. Coat a 30x20 cm lamington tray with butter. Place the semolina, melted butter and sugar in a large bowl and stir until well combined; set aside.
3. Place the yogurt and baking soda in a medium bowl and stir to combine. Set aside until the mixture has nearly doubled in size, about 10 minutes.
4. Pour the yogurt mixture over the semolina mixture and mix well to combine. Transfer to the buttered baking dish and press into an even layer. Using a knife, score the surface of the namoura on the diagonal into 2-inch diamond-shaped pieces. Top each diamond in the center with an almond. Bake until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.
5. Place baking dish on a wire rack and drizzle the cooled syrup over the top of the hot namoura. Let cool to room temperature before recutting along the scored lines and serving.
