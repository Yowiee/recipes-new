## Ingredients

#### Base
- 200g ginger nut biscuits
- 80g unsalted butter, melted

#### Filling
- 3 gelatine leaves (you will need platinum grade ones – I used Dr Oetker)
- 1 x 450g tin kesar or alphonso mango pulp, or 1 large ripe mango
- Juice and zest of 2 limes
- 50g caster sugar
- 250ml double cream

## Directions

1. Put the ginger nuts in a food processor and blitz until fine. Tip into a bowl and add the melted butter, mixing until evenly coated. Pour the mixture into a fluted 23cm tart tin, and press evenly into the base and up the sides. Chill in the fridge for 20 minutes while you make the filling.
2 .Put the gelatine sheets into a small bowl of cold water and set aside.
3. If using fresh mango, peel and chop the flesh. Put it into a food processor along with the lime juice, and blitz smooth. Pass through a fine sieve.
4. Add the mango puree (tinned or fresh), sugar (and lime juice if using tinned, as you won’t have used it yet) to a small saucepan and heat until the sugar dissolves. Let it simmer for three to five minutes, then remove from the heat and leave to cool a little. Squeeze the gelatine leaves to remove any excess water and add them to the mango, stirring to dissolve.
5. In a separate bowl, whip the cream to soft peaks. Add a quarter of the cream into the mango, and mix to combine. Gently fold in the rest of the cream and then pour this into the tart case.
6. Chill in the fridge for four to six hours or until completely set. Top with lime zest before serving.
