## Ingredients

#### CRUST
- 22 finely crushed Oreos cookies
- 84g unsalted butter, melted

#### CHEESECAKE
- 2 blocks (500 g) cream cheese, softened
- 1 c. (250 g) smooth peanut butter
- 1 c. (115 g) confectioners' sugar
- 1 tsp. pure vanilla extract

#### TOPPING
- 3/4 c. semisweet chocolate chips
- 1 tsp. oil (olive or vegetable)

## Directions


#### CRUST
1. Line a 9"x9" pan with parchment, leaving a 2" overhang on 2 opposite sides.
2. In a medium bowl, mix Oreos and butter until combined. Pour into prepared pan and spread in an even layer, pressing with a measuring cup or spoon. Refrigerate until ready to use.

#### CHEESECAKE
1. In a large bowl, using a handheld mixer on medium-high speed, beat cream cheese and peanut butter until smooth. Add confectioners' sugar and vanilla and beat until combined.
2. Spoon over crust and spread in an even layer. Refrigerate until well chilled, at least 2 hours or up to overnight.

#### TOPPING
1. In a small heatproof bowl, microwave chips and oil in 30-second increments, stirring between each, until melted and smooth.
2. Pour chocolate over cheesecake and spread in an even layer, working quickly so chocolate doesnâ€™t harden. Refrigerate until chocolate is hardened, about 30 minutes.
3. Using parchment overhang, remove cheesecake from pan and cut into squares.
