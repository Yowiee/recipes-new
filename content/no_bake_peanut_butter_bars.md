## Ingredients

#### Base
- 115g melted salted butter
- 1 cup crushed Arnott's Marie crackers (11 crackers)
- 1 cup icing sugar
- 3/4 cup peanut butter (smooth)

#### Topping
- 1 cup dark chocolate chips
- 2 tbs peanut butter (smooth)

## Directions

1. Butter and line a 8" / 20cm square dish or pan with baking paper.
2. Place the Base ingredients in a bowl and mix until combined. Press into the prepared pan.
3. Melt the Topping ingredients (I do it in the microwave in 2 x 30 second bursts). Pour and spread over the Base - smooth the top or do swirls (see photos for examples of each).
4. Refrigerate until set - about 1 1/2 hours. Remove from fridge, allow to come to room temp slightly (so top cuts neatly). Cut into 16 squares (or whatever shape you want!). Best served at room temperature.
