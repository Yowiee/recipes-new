## Ingredients

- 225g chocolate melts
- 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter
- 225g butter, softened, plus more for greasing the pan
- 1 cup crunchy peanut butter
- 2 cup icing sugar
- 340g plain bisuits, Arnott's Marie
- 180g chocolate chips
- 1/2 cup chopped peanuts

## Directions

1. For the topping: Using a double boiler or a microwave, melt the chocolate chips and creamy peanut butter. Allow to cool for a couple of minutes while you make the bars.
2. For the bars: Grease a 13-by-9-inch pan with some butter. Using a stand or electric hand mixer, mix together the butter and crunchy peanut butter until smooth. Stir in the icing sugar, 1 cup at a time.
3. Add the plain bisuits to a food processor and process until they are in crumbs. Add the crumbs and chocolate chips to the peanut butter mixture, and mix until just combined. Spread it evenly into the buttered pan and set aside.
4. Pour the topping over the base. Spread it evenly and sprinkle with the peanuts. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour, then cut into 20 bars.
5. Keep refrigerated as the bars and chocolate will soften at room temperature.
