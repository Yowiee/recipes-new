## Ingredients

#### Cups:
- 80 g rolled oats
- 30 g almond flour
- 260 g natural peanut butter
- 160 g maple syrup (or honey)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 tsp salt

#### Chocolate Topping:
- 90 g chocolate chips
- 2 tbs peanut butter

## Directions

1. Cups: In a medium bowl, mix together the oats, almond flour, peanut butter, syrup, vanilla and salt. Transfer to a muffin tin lined with liners evenly amongst 10 slots. Flatten out as best as possible. Freeze the tray for at least 2 hours.
2. Chocolate Topping: In a small pot over low heat, melt the chocolate chips and peanut butter, stirring constantly until smooth and melted. Remove the tray from the freezer and drop about 1 -2 tbs of chocolate on the tops of each and smooth it out flat. Sprinkle with the flaky salt and freeze for another hour.
