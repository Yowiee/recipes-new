## Ingredients

1 cup (100g) rolled oats 
3/4 cup (200g) creamy peanut or almond butter 
1/2 cup (70g) almond flour or ground flax seed
2 tablespoons (30g) maple syrup or honey
1/2 cup small mix-ins like mini chocolate chips, dried fruit, or sprinkles 
1/2 teaspoon salt

## Directions

1. In a medium bowl, combine the oats, nut butter, almond flour or flax, maple syrup or honey, your mix-ins of choice, and salt. Use a spatula or wooden spoon to combine well. You can switch to clean hands and knead the mixture together if it gets too hard to mix.
2. Use a spoon or cookie scoop to portion the dough into 12 balls about the size of a ping ping ball. Roll to form a solid ball. You can portion these directly into a flat storage container with a lid or onto a parchment-lined baking sheet.
3. Chill for 1 hour to firm and then move to an airtight container for longer-term storage. These energy balls can be kept in the fridge in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks. For longer storage, freeze solid on a baking sheet and then move to a zip-top bag for up to 2 months. Serve frozen or thaw in the fridge first.
