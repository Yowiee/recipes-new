## Ingredients

- 120 grams quick-cooking or plain instant oats (see Tip)
- 133 grams all-purpose flour
- 160 grams packed dark brown sugar
- 1 tbs baking powder
- 1/2 tsp fine salt
- 1/4 tsp ground cardamom
- 300 grams whole milk
- 60 grams unsalted butter, melted and cooled
- 2 large eggs, room temperature
- 120 grams chocolate chips 

## Directions

1. Heat the oven to 200°C (190°C fan). Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners.
2. Whisk the oats, flour, brown sugar, baking powder, salt and cardamom in a large bowl. Whisk the milk, butter and eggs in a medium bowl. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and stir gently until no traces of flour remain. Gently stir in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed.
3. Use the ⅓-cup measuring cup to scoop the batter into the muffin cups. They’ll be nearly full.
4. Bake until browned around the edges and a toothpick inserted in the center of one comes out clean, 20 to 23 minutes.
5. Cool in the muffin tin until room temperature. You can eat the muffins warm, but they’ll be a bit gummy before they cool. Muffins will keep at room temperature for up to 3 days and can be frozen for up to 3 months. Thaw completely before reheating in a toaster oven.

#### Notes
Quick-cooking oats are slightly flatter and cut smaller than old-fashioned oats, and instant oats are even smaller and thinner. If you have only old-fashioned (rolled) oats, pulse them into tiny bits to replicate the lighter texture that quick-cooking oats deliver.
