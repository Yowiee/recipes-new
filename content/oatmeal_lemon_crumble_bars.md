## Ingredients

#### Crust & Topping
- 100g unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
- 3/4 cup (150g) packed light or dark brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 1 cup (125g) all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup (85g) old-fashioned rolled oats

####Lemon Filling
- 400g) can full-fat sweetened condensed milk
- 6 Tablespoons (90ml) lemon juice (about 2 lemons)
- 1 Tablespoon lemon zest (about 1 lemon)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 170°C. Line an 8-inch square pan with parchment paper.
2. For the crust/topping: Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and brown sugar together on medium-high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula and then add the vanilla extract. Beat on medium-high speed until combined, about 30 seconds. Add the flour, baking powder, salt, and oats. Beat on medium speed until combined. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine. Mixture will appear dry and be crumbly. You will have between 3–3.5 cups of crust/crumble mixture.
3. **Lightly** press a little more than half of crumble mixture into bottom of prepared baking pan. (You want a little more mixture for the crust than for the topping.) Bake for 12 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, make the lemon filling: Whisk sweetened condensed milk, lemon juice, and lemon zest together. Mixture will be thick.
5. Pour and spread filling over pre-baked crust (while crust is hot). Sprinkle the remaining crumble mixture on top.
6. Return bars to the oven and bake for 22–25 minutes or until edges are very lightly browned and appear set. Avoid over-baking. Remove from the oven and place the pan on a wire rack. Cool bars completely.
7. Lift the bars out using the parchment paper overhang on the sides. Cut into squares.
8. Cover leftover bars and store at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
