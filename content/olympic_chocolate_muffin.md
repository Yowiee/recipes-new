## Ingredients

- 3 tsp instant coffee granules
- 1/2 cup hot milk
- 2 cups plain flour
- 1/2 cup Dutch cocoa powder
- 1¼ tsp bicarb soda
- ¾ cup (170g) firmly packed dark brown sugar
- 1 cup (280g) thick Greek-style yoghurt
- ½ cup (125ml) vegetable oil
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten
- 1 tsp vanilla bean paste
- 100g dark (70%) chocolate, roughly chopped, plus 12 squares extra
- 100g milk chocolate, roughly chopped

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 190°C/170°C fan-forced. Line a 12-hole, ⅓-cup capacity muffin pan with paper cases.
2. Dissolve the instant coffee in a large jug with the hot milk. Sift the flour, cocoa, bicarb and a generous pinch of fine salt over a large bowl. Add the sugar and whisk until thoroughly combined. Add the yoghurt, oil, egg and vanilla to the coffee mixture and whisk until smooth and combined. Add to the flour mixture and stir until just combined.
3. Reserve one-third of the chopped chocolate (reserve the larger chunks). Add remaining two-thirds chocolate to the batter and stir until just combined.
4. Divide the batter between paper cases. Top with reserve chocolate chunks. Bake for 22 minutes or until a skewer inserted at centre comes out clean. Push a square of dark chocolate into the centre of each muffin and stand for 10 minutes.
5. Serve warm for a soft chocolate centre, or at room temperature.
