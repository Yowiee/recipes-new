## Ingredients

- 1¼ cups/165 grams all-purpose flour
- 1 cup/220 grams packed light brown sugar
- ½ cup/100 grams granulated sugar
- ¾ teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon fine salt
- 226 grams hot brewed coffee
- 140 grams unsalted butter, cut into pieces
- ⅓ cup/56 grams Dutch-processed cocoa powder
- 2 large eggs
- 1½ cups/216 grams chocolate chunks

## Directions

1. Make the muffins: Heat the oven to 210°C with a rack in the center. Line a standard muffin tin with paper liners, then lightly coat the whole pan (including the top and the muffin cups), with nonstick cooking spray.
2. Whisk the flour, both sugars, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl.
3. Combine the coffee, butter and cocoa powder in a large bowl and let sit for a minute. The heat of the coffee will start to melt the butter. Whisk until very smooth, then whisk in the eggs until smooth. Add the dry ingredients and stir with the whisk until no pockets of flour remain.
4. Divide the batter, then ¾ cup/108 grams of the chocolate chunks, evenly among the prepared muffin cups. Batter will be thin, so consider using a scoop or a measuring cup. The chunks will sink, and the batter will reach the tops.
5. Bake until crackly on top and a toothpick inserted in the center of one comes out with a few crumbs, 15 to 18 minutes. Be sure to not overbake to keep these moist. The muffins will continue to bake as they cool in the pan.
6. Immediately after the muffins come out of the oven, gently press the remaining ¾ cup/108 grams chocolate chunks on the tops. They’ll melt a bit and stick. You can enjoy the muffins on their own, or you can cool them a bit to fill while they’re still warm.
