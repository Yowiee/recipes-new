## Ingredients

- 1kg chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized chunks
- 250g pearl couscous
- 60ml (¼ cup) olive oil
- 1 tsp salt flakes
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp sumac
- 3 garlic cloves, crushed
- 2 tbsp tomato paste (concentrated purée)
- 1 tbsp pomegranate syrup, date syrup or honey
- 625ml (2½ cups) boiling chicken stock

#### To serve (garnish)
- Chopped coriander and parsley leaves
- Smoked almonds
- Fried onions

#### Quick lemon sumac dressing (optional)
- Juice of 1 lemon
- ½ cup Greek yoghurt
- Sumac, to taste

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 180°C.
2. Put the chicken and couscous in a roasting pan. Drizzle over the olive oil.
3. Add the salt, spices, garlic, tomato paste and syrup or honey, giving it all a quick toss to combine, then spread out evenly.
4. Pour over the chicken stock, place a piece of baking paper on top to touch and then wrap tightly with foil. Bake in the oven for 30 minutes.
5. Remove the foil and baking paper, and return to the oven for another 15 minutes or until the liquid has been absorbed and the chicken is cooked through.
6. If making the dressing, combine the ingredients in a bowl.
7. Garnish with the dressing (if using), chopped coriander and parsley, smoked almonds and then serve with fried onions.
