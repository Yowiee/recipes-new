## Ingredients

- 2 cups basmati rice
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 small brown onion, finely diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 500g chicken thigh fillet, cut into strips
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon ground paprika
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 400g can diced tomatoes
- 3 cups chicken stock

## Directions

1. Rinse the basmati rice in cold water until the water runs clear.
2. In a large pot, which has a lid, heat the oil and melt the butter over medium heat. Add the diced onion and sauté until it becomes translucent, about 5 minutes.
3. Add the minced garlic and cook for another 1–2 minutes until fragrant. Add the chicken and continue cooking until the chicken is sealed on all sides.
4. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for about 2 minutes to develop its flavour.
5. Add the cumin, paprika, cinnamon, salt, pepper, diced tomatoes, and rice to the pot. Stir to coat the rice with the tomato and spice mixture.
6. Pour in the stock and stir well to mix the seasoning evenly throughout the rice and liquid.
7. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium–high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and simmer for 15 minutes until the rice is tender and has absorbed all the liquid. You can tie a tea towel around the pot's lid to give you extra fluffy rice (see tips and photo above to do it safely).
8. Remove the pot from the heat and let it sit, covered, for an additional 5–10 minutes to steam. Fluff the rice with a fork before serving. This dish is delicious topped with freshly chopped parsley, a side of Greek yoghurt or a cucumber raita or a salad.
