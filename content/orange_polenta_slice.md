## Ingredients

- 1 cup polenta
- 1/2 cup almond meal (ground almonds)
- 1/2 cup caster sugar
- 1/2 cup plain flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1 orange, rind finely grated
- 1/2 cup light olive oil
- 1/2 cup buttermilk
- 1 egg, lightly beaten

#### Orange syrup
- 1/2 cup white sugar
- 1 large orange, rind finely grated, juiced

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 170Â°C. Grease a 3cm-deep, 18 x 28cm (base) slab pan. Line with baking paper (see note).
2. Place polenta, almond meal and caster sugar in a large bowl. Sift flour and baking powder together over polenta mixture. Add orange rind and stir to combine. Whisk oil, buttermilk and egg together. Add to polenta mixture. Mix until well combined.
3. Pour mixture into prepared pan and smooth the surface. Bake for 20 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Set aside in pan for 10 minutes.
4. Make orange syrup: Meanwhile, combine white sugar, 1 tablespoon orange rind and 1/2 cup orange juice in a small saucepan over low heat. Cook, stirring, for 3 to 4 minutes or until sugar dissolves. Increase heat to medium-high. Simmer, uncovered, for 2 to 3 minutes or until the syrup reduces and thickens slightly. Remove pan from heat.
5. Lift slice onto a wire rack. Cut into pieces. Place on a plate and spoon over the syrup. Serve warm or at room temperature.

#### Notes
- Lining a slab pan: Lightly grease the base and sides of a slab pan, paying particular attention to the two short ends. Cut out a sheet of baking paper, allowing a 2cm overhang at each long side. Use the overhang to lift slice from pan in one piece.
