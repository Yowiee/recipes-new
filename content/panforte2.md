## Ingredients

- 1 cup dry-roasted almonds
- 120g packet skinless hazelnuts, toasted
- 1/3 cup pistachio kernels
- 2/3 cup plain flour
- 1 tsp mixed spice
- 2 tbsp cocoa powder, sifted
- 4 dried figs, finely chopped (see note)
- 50g dark chocolate, chopped
- 1/2 cup honey
- 1/3 cup caster sugar
- 3/4 cup fruit mince (see note)
- Icing sugar mixture, to serve

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 180C/160C fan-forced. Grease a 6cm-deep, 20cm round cake pan. Line base and side with baking paper.
2. Combine nuts, flour, mixed spice, cocoa and figs in a large heatproof bowl.
3. Place chocolate, honey and caster sugar in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until sugar is dissolved. Bring to a simmer. Reduce heat. Simmer, without stirring, for 2 minutes.
4. Make a well in the centre of nut mixture. Add honey syrup and fruit mince. Stir well to combine. Spoon mixture into prepared pan. Level top. Bake for 30 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the centre of cake comes out clean. Cool completely in pan. Serve dusted with icing sugar.
