## Ingredients

#### For the jelly
- 2 tsp gelatine powder
- 200ml passion fruit juice, fresh or from a carton

#### For the cake
- Butter, for greasing
- 35g plain flour, plus extra for dusting
- 1 large egg
- 35g caster sugar
- ¼ tsp salt
- 75g dark chocolate, chopped

## Directions
1. Start by making the jelly. Sprinkle gelatine powder in 2 tbs cold water . Whisk with a fork and stand for 1 minute. Melt in the microwave for 20 second increments until dissolved. Meanwhile, line a small, roughly 20cm x 15cm baking dish or tray with baking paper.
2. Put the passion fruit juice in a saucepan, heat gently until steaming, then, before it comes to a boil, take off the heat. Add the gelatine to the juice and stir to dissolve. Pour into the lined dish and chill in the fridge for three to four hours, until firmly set.
3. Heat the oven to 190°C (170°C fan). Lightly grease nine holes of a cupcake tray, then lightly dust them with flour.
4. Put the egg and sugar in a bowl and use an electric whisk to whip until thick and fluffy. Sift on the flour and salt, then fold in gently, taking care not to knock out too much air. Spoon about a tablespoon of batter into each greased cupcake hole, then bake for 15 minutes, until golden and springy to the touch. Remove from the oven, leave to cool in the tin for a few minutes, then turn out the cakes.
5. Use a cutter slightly smaller than the width of the cakes to stamp out nine discs of the set jelly, then place one on top of each cake.
6. Melt the chocolate in short bursts in the microwave (or over a bain-marie), then leave to cool a little. Spoon a little chocolate on to each cake, nudging it around evenly, then leave to firm up before serving.
