## Ingredients

#### Topping
- 1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts or pecans
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon or a combination of ground cinnamon, nutmeg, mace, and ginger

#### Cake
- 3 eggs
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1/3 cup vegetable oil
- 3/4 cup matzo cake meal
- 5 medium apples, peeled, cored, halved, and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices (about 5 cups)
- 1/3 cup raisins (optional)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 160Â°C. Spray an 8 inch square glass pan with oil.

First, make the topping. Mix the walnuts, 3/4 cup sugar and cinnamon in a bowl.

Next, work on the cake. Beat the eggs until light and fluffy (at least five minutes). Slowly add the 1/2 cup sugar (do not dump in all at once). Add the oil and then fold in the matzo flour.

Now start to layer the cake. Pour about half to two thirds of the batter in the pan. Scatter some of the topping over the batter.

Gently lay half of the apples over top. If you are including raisins, add all of them now.

Cover with the batter you have left.

Layer the remaining apples over the batter then add the extra topping on top.

Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes.

Let the cake cool completely in the pan.
