## Ingredients

#### For the bars:
- 85 g unsalted butter, room temperature
- 65 g brown sugar
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 285 g creamy peanut butter
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 30 g corn flakes
- 50 g digestive biscuit crumbs
- 150 g icing sugar

#### For the glaze:
- 225 g dark chocolate
- 80 g heavy cream

## Directions

1. For the bars: Grease an 8-inch square baking pan and line with a parchment sling.
2. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle (or whisk if you don’t have a paddle), beat the butter until creamy, about 1 minute. Add the brown sugar and salt and beat to combine, then add the peanut butter and vanilla and beat until combined and creamy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the corn flakes and graham cracker crumbs and mix again until combined. Add the confectioners’ sugar and mix until completely combined.
3. Transfer the peanut butter mixture to the prepared pan and gently press it into the pan, covering the whole surface. Use your hands or the bottom of a measuring cup to even out the top. Chill for 1 hour.
4. For the glaze: Place the chocolate in a small heatproof bowl. In a small saucepan over medium heat, heat the heavy cream until simmering and just about to boil. Pour the cream over the chocolate, cover the bowl with plastic wrap,  and let sit for 5 minutes.
5. Remove the plastic wrap and stir the chocolate into the cream until completely smooth.
6. Pour the glaze over the chilled peanut butter bars and use an offset spatula to smooth the glaze evenly. Chill the bars again for 1 hour. Slice the bars into squares and serve. The bars can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
