## Ingredients

- 230g salted butter, plus extra for greasing
- 140g golden syrup
- 80g demerara sugar
- 100g smooth peanut butter
- 400g porridge oats
- 50g dark chocolate, melted
- 30g salted roasted peanuts, roughly chopped

## Directions

1. Heat the oven to 160Â°C, and grease and line a square 20cm cake tin with enough baking paper to leave an overhang.
2. Put the butter, golden syrup, sugar and peanut butter in a small saucepan and heat gently until combined.
3. Put the oats in a large bowl, then pour over the hot butter mixture and give it a good mix so everything is evenly coated.
4. Tip the oat mixture into the prepared tin, pressing it down firmly, then bake for 25-30 minutes, until the edges are golden; it will still look a little soft in the middle. (If you like your flapjacks crispier, bake for six to 10 minutes longer.) Take the tin out of the oven and leave to cool completely, because slicing while the flapjacks are still warm will make them crumble.
5. Once cool, drizzle the melted chocolate on top, sprinkle with the chopped peanuts, slice and serve.
