## Directions

#### CRUST
1. Place a 9" tart pan with a removable bottom on a baking sheet. In a medium bowl, whisk flour, confectioners’ sugar, cocoa powder, and salt. Add butter and mix until combined. Press dough into bottom and all the way up sides of prepared pan. Dock bottom of dough with a fork. Freeze until just firm, about 10 minutes.
2. Preheat oven to 350°. Bake crust until firm to the touch but still shiny, about 12 minutes. Let cool.
3. Make Ahead: Crust can be made 2 days ahead. Tightly wrap pan in plastic wrap and store at room temperature.

#### FILLING
1. Place a rack in center of oven; preheat to 350°. In a large bowl, whisk eggs until combined. Add granulated sugar, peanut butter, brown sugar, butter, milk, cornmeal, vinegar, vanilla, and salt and whisk to combine.
2. Pour filling into crust and carefully transfer to oven. Bake pie until filling is set, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool.

#### GANACHE
1. Place chopped chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl. In a small saucepan over low heat, bring cream to a simmer. Pour cream over chocolate and let sit 2 minutes. Whisk until smooth. 
2. Pour ganache over top of cool pie. Refrigerate until ganache is set and firm, about 1 hour. Remove sides of tart pan, then cut into slices.
3. Make Ahead: Pie can be made 1 day ahead. Tightly wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate.
