## Ingredients

- 115g butter
- 450g brown sugar
- 1/2 cup milk
- 220g smooth peanut butter (see note)
- 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
- 500g icing sugar

## Directions

1. Line a 20cm square pan with baking paper that covers the sides of the pan.
2. Put the powdered sugar into a large bowl. Set aside.
3. Put the butter in a saucepan. Melt. Add the brown sugar and milk. Bring to a boil and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat. Add the peanut butter and vanilla.
4. Pour the mixture over the powdered sugar and beat well. Pour into a square baking pan. Put in the fridge until firm. Cut into squares. 

#### Note:
- Do not use an all natural peanut butter. The oil separates from the peanut butter, making it difficult to get the right consistency.
