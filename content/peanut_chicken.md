## Ingredients

- 4 x 120g free-range skinless chicken breasts
- 3 limes
- 6 cloves of garlic
- 4 heaped tablespoons peanut butter
- 2-3 fresh red chillies

## Directions

1. Turn the grill on to medium-high.
2. Score the chicken breasts in a criss-cross fashion, rub with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, a pinch of sea salt and black pepper and the finely grated zest of 2 limes.
3. Place criss-cross side down in a cold non-stick ovenproof frying pan and put it on a medium-high heat, while you peel and finely grate the garlic into a bowl.
4. Squeeze in the juice from 2 limes, stir in the peanut butter and loosen with enough water to give you a spoonable consistency.
5. Finely slice the chilli, then mix (as much as you dare!) through the sauce, taste and season to perfection.
6. Flip the chicken over, spoon over the sauce, then transfer to the grill, roughly 10cm from the heat, for 5 minutes, or until gnarly and cooked through.
7. Finely grate over the remaining lime zest, then drizzle with 1 teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil. Serve with lime wedges, for squeezing over.
