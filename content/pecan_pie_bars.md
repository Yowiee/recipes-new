## Ingredients

#### Crust:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 3/4 cup unsalted butter, cold and cut into small cubes

#### Filling:
- 2/3 cup brown sugar, packed
- 1/3 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/2 cups raw sugar dissolved in 1/3 cup warm water
- 4 large eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 cups pecans, chopped

## Directions

1. Preheat your oven to 170°C. Grease and line a 20×30cm baking pan with parchment paper. Leave some paper hanging over the side for easy removal.
2. In a large bowl, whisk the flour, sugar, and salt. Then, using a pastry cutter or your fingers, work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.
3. Press this mixture firmly into the bottom of the prepared pan. Bake for 20 minutes, or until lightly golden. Remove from oven and set aside.
4. While the crust is baking, prepare the filling. In a large bowl, mix the brown sugar, flour, and salt. Whisk in the corn syrup, eggs, and vanilla until smooth. Fold in the chopped pecans.
5. Pour the filling over the hot crust. Bake for an additional 30-35 minutes, or until the filling is set and the top is a deep golden brown.
6. Let the bars cool in the pan on a wire rack then cut into squares or rectangles. Serve and enjoy!

#### Notes:
* Use cold butter. It’s how you keep the crust nice and crumbly. Another option is to freeze it, grate it, and mix it with the flour. Easy peasy.
* Mix-Ins: Add 3 tablespoons of bourbon or 1/3 cup of chocolate chips to the filling.
