## Ingredients

#### Fudgy Brownies:

- 100 g high quality dark chocolate, between 60-70% cocoa
- 140 g unsalted butter
- 165 g granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs, at room temperature 
- 1 tsp instant coffee mixed with 1 tablespoon hot water
- ½ cup all purpose flour, sifted (about 65g)
- ⅓ cup cocoa powder, sifted (about 35g)
- ¾ tsp salt

#### Pecan Pie Topping:

- ¼ cup maple syrup (80g)
- ¾ cup light or dark brown sugar (150g)
- 60 g unsalted butter, melted
- 1 large egg
- ½ tsp salt
- 1 tsp vanilla
- 2 cups pecan halves and pieces (or roughly chopped pecans), toasted for 7-8 minutes in the oven at 180°C

## Directions

#### Fudgy Brownies:

1. Pre-heat your oven to 160°C and line a 9x9” baking pan with parchment paper and a light coating of butter / oil
2. Melt the butter and dark chocolate in a microwave safe bowl, using 20 second increments in the microwave and stirring in between. Avoid over-heating the mixture as the chocolate can seize up
3. In the meanwhile, whisk the eggs and sugar using a stand mixer or electric hand mixer at medium-high speed using the whisk attachment for 3-5 minutes. You should achieve a very thick and ribbony mixture which is light in color 
4. Pour the chocolate & butter mixture into the egg and sugar mixture, and gently whisk at low speed until combined 
5. Mix the instant coffee with hot water, and pour in. Gently fold into the batter
6. Sift in the flour, cocoa powder and salt. Gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet using a rubber spatula. Be careful not to knock out the air in the batter
7. Pour the batter into the lined pan and spread evenly
8. Bake partially at 160°C for just 15 minutes, then remove from the oven and increase the oven temperature to 170°C. Rest the brownies for 5-10 minutes at room temperature 

#### Pecan Pie Topping:
1. Add the maple syrup, brown sugar, melted butter, egg, salt and vanilla to a bowl and whisk until fully combined
2. Stir in the toasted pecans and mix
3. Once the brownies have partially baked and rested for 5-10 minutes, spread the pecan filling on top. Return to the oven (which should be at 170°C now) and bake for ~30 minutes until the pecans filling looks golden brown on top
4. Remove from oven (it's ok for there to be some gooey syrup, think of it like caramel sauce) and optionally sprinkle with sea salt
5. Rest the brownies in the pan for 1 hour. Then remove, cut into slices, and enjoy!


#### Note:
* Make sure the pecans are toasted before starting!
