## Ingredients

- 6 tablespoons olive oil
- ¼ cup pine nuts or sliced almonds
- ½ teaspoon ground turmeric
- Salt and pepper
- 3 large shallots, sliced thinly (about 2 cups)
- 5 garlic cloves, sliced thinly
- 2 420g cans cannellini beans or other creamy white beans, drained
- 1 cup vegetable or chicken stock
- 1 cup finely grated Parmesan (about 4 ounces), plus more for serving
- 1½ cups tightly packed basil leaves, preferably Genovese
- 1 lemon, cut into wedges, for serving

## Directions

1. Heat 4 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium-low in a 12-inch skillet or small Dutch oven. Add the pine nuts and, when the oil starts sizzling, stir occasionally until golden brown, about 5 minutes; turn off heat. Stir in the turmeric and season lightly with salt and pepper. Transfer to a small serving bowl.
2. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium-high in the same skillet. When warm, add the shallots and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring until just softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in the garlic, and when sizzling (about 1 minute), stir in the beans and stock. Bring to a simmer then turn heat down to low.
3. In a few additions, sprinkle in the cheese, stirring vigorously to combine. When the cheese has melted into the broth and the mixture looks creamy, season to taste with salt and then turn off the heat. While the beans are still hot, tear the basil leaves (or roughly chop, if you prefer) and stir into the beans.
4. Serve hot, in bowls or on plates, drizzled with the sizzled nut oil, a squeeze of lemon juice and more black pepper and grated Parmesan, if desired.
