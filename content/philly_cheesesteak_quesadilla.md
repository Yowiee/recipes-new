## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided 
- 12 oz. sirloin steak
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced
- 1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
- 1 green bell pepper, thinly sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
- 2 medium flour tortillas
- 1/2 c. shredded mozzarella
- 1/2 c. shredded provolone

## Directions

1.â€‹ In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat. Season steak on both sides with salt and pepper. Add steak to skillet and cook until desired doneness, 3 to 4 minutes per side for medium. Transfer steak to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes. Slice into thin strips. 
2. Add onion and peppers to the skillet and cook over medium heat until soft, about 8 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 minute more. Return sliced steak to skillet, add Worcestershire and stir to coat. Transfer pepper/steak mixture to a plate and wipe out skillet. 
3. Place a tortilla on a clean work surface. Sprinkle a quarter of the mozzarella on the bottom half, top with a quarter of the pepper/steak mixture, and a quarter of the provolone. Fold top half of tortilla over on top of filling. Repeat to make 3 more quesadillas. 
4. Return skillet to medium heat and add remaining tablespoon oil. Working in batches, add quesadillas to skillet and cook until golden and cheese is melty, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
