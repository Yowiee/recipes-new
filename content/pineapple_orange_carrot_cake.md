## Ingredients

- 320g plain flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp bicarb of soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp vanilla paste
- 4 eggs
- 180ml olive oil
- juice and grated zest of 1 orange
- 4 carrots, coarsely grated (about 2 cups)
- 400g can crushed pineapple, drained
- 1 cup soft brown sugar
- ½ cup caster sugar
- 1 cup walnuts, roughly chopped

#### CREAM CHEESE ICING
- 125g unsalted butter
- 250g cream cheese
- 1 tsp vanilla paste
- ½ tsp salt
- 300g icing sugar mixture

## Directions

1. Heat your oven to 160C fan-forced (180C conventional). Grease and line a 25cm square tin. Sift the flour, baking powder and bicarb together. Add the salt, vanilla, eggs, olive oil, orange juice and zest, grated carrots, pineapple and sugars and mix to combine. Transfer to the cake tin and bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Cool in the tin for 20 minutes, then remove.
2. For the icing, beat the butter, cheese and vanilla together, then slowly beat in the icing sugar and salt until fluffy. Spread on top of the cake, scatter with the walnuts, and serve.
