## Ingredients

- 50g butter or margarine, softened
- 1 1/4 cups caster sugar

- 440g can crushed pineapple (with juice)
- 85g packet lemon jelly crystals
- 1 cup chilled Evaporated Milk
- 1 tbsp lemon juice

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 180Â°C. Grease and line a 3cm deep, 24cm x 30cm (base) lamington pan. Using an electric mixer, beat butter and 1/2 cup sugar until pale and creamy. Stir in egg, cornflakes, coconut, flour, cocoa and a pinch of salt.
2. Press mixture into pan. Bake for 20 minutes or until light golden. Cool.
