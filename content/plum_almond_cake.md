## Ingredients

- 150g unsalted butter, softened, plus extra for coating the pan
- 150g golden caster sugar (alt. mix brown and white sugar)
- 2 cups (240g) almond meal
- 3 Range Eggs
- 2 tbsp Grand Marnier or other orange liqueur
- 1 orange, finely grated zest only
- 1/4 tsp almond essence
- 1/4 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/2 cup (75g) plain flour
- 5 plums (200g), pitted, each cut into 8 wedges

## Directions


1. Preheat the oven to 160°C. Coat a 23cm round springform pan with butter.
2. Using an electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar on medium speed until light and creamy. Gradually beat in the almond meal.
3. Add the eggs one at a time. Mix in the Grand Marnier, orange zest, almond essence, baking powder and salt. Reduce the speed to low and mix in the flour until just blended. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan.
4. In a small bowl, toss the plum wedges with 1 tbs caster sugar. Gently place the plum wedges on top of the batter. 
5. Bake for 40 mins or until a toothpick inserted into the centre of the cake comes out with a few moist crumbs. Transfer the cake to a wire rack and allow to cool in the pan for 10 mins.
