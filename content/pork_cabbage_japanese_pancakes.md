## Ingredients

- 250g pork mince
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 1/2 cups (225g) self-raising flour
- 2 free-range eggs
- 3/4 cup (185ml) salt-reduced chicken stock
- 1/2 green cabbage, finely shredded
- 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1/4 cup (75g) mayonnaise
- 1/4 cup (75g) sriracha mayonnaise
- 1 carrot, peeled, cut into long matchsticks
- 2 spring onions, thinly sliced

## Directions

1. Heat a large non-stick frying pan over high heat. Cook the mince, stirring with a wooden spoon to break up lumps, for 5 mins or until mince changes colour. Add the soy sauce. Cook, stirring, for 2 mins. Transfer to a heatproof bowl. Wipe the pan clean with paper towel and place over medium heat.
2. Combine the flour and eggs in a large bowl. Add the chicken stock and stir until smooth. Add the mince and half the cabbage. Season.
3. Spray the frying pan with olive oil spray. Spoon one-quarter of the batter into the pan and cook for 2 mins or until bubbles appear on the surface. Turn the pancake and brush with a little Worcestershire sauce. Cook for 1 min or until cooked through. Turn and brush with a little more Worcestershire sauce. Transfer the pancake to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm. Repeat with remaining batter and Worcestershire sauce to make 4 pancakes.
4. Divide the pancakes among serving plates. Drizzle with the mayonnaise and sriracha mayonnaise. Top with the carrot, spring onion and remaining cabbage to serve.
