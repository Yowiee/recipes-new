- 350g Ricotta, crumbled
- 35g (1/3 cup) quinoa flakes
- 25g (1/3 cup) finely grated parmesan
- 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh chives
- 1 egg, lightly whisked
- 1 lemon, rind finely grated
- 2 1/2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil

- 1 garlic clove, crushed
- 700g btl Tomato Passata
- 1/2 tsp caster sugar
- Baby spinach leaves, to serve

## Directions

1. Place the pumpkin in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on High, covered, for 4-5 minutes or until tender. Transfer to a sieve. Set aside to drain for 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and mash until smooth.
2. Add the ricotta, quinoa, parmesan, chives, egg and lemon rind to the pumpkin. Season. Stir until combined.
3. Heat 2 tsp of the oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the basil and garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds or until aromatic. Stir in the passata and sugar and simmer for 5 minutes or until thickened slightly. Season. Set aside and keep warm.
4. Heat 1 tbs of the oil in a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Spoon four 1‚ÅÑ4 cupfuls of pumpkin mixture into pan, spreading to 1cm thick. Cook for 2 minutes or until golden brown. Use an egg lifter to turn. Cook for a further 2 minutes or until cooked through. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining oil and pumpkin mixture to make 8 fritters.
5. Serve fritters with the tomato sauce. Sprinkle with the spinach, basil leaves and extra parmesan.
