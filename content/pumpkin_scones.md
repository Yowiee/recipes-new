## Ingredients

- 300g butternut pumpkin, peeled and cut into 2cm cubes
- 3 1/2 cups (525g) wholemeal self-raising flour
- 1/2 cup buttermilk
- 3/4 cup reduced fat milk
- 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 200Â°C. Line a baking tray with baking paper and set aside.
2. Place pumpkin in a small saucepan with water. Bring to the boil and cook for 15-20 minutes or until pumpkin is tender.
3. Drain pumpkin and place into a medium-sized bowl. Mash pumpkin and set aside to cool for 10 minutes.
4. Combine self-raising flour, buttermilk and milk into a large mixing bowl. Add pumpkin and nutmeg, working quickly with clean hands to combine all ingredients.
5. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead gently until all ingredients are well combined. Be careful not to over knead as this will make your scones tough.
6. Pat dough down until it is 2cm in thickness.
7. Using a 6cm scone cutter, cut rounds and place onto the prepared baking tray.
8. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until scones are golden and well risen.
9. Serve fresh or allow to cool then freeze scones individually in cling wrap, or small airtight containers.
