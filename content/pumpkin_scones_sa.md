## Ingredients

- 250g pumpkin (peeled and cut into chunks)
- 300g self raising flour
- Pinch of salt
- 20g butter
- 1 egg lightly beaten
- milk

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 200Â°C. Steam pumpkin until soft, then dry off briefly in oven and puree. Sift flour with salt and rub in butter and pumpkin puree. Add egg and up to 1/4 cup milk, if necessary, to make a soft dough, then turn out onto a floured baking tray.
2. With floured hands, pat dough into a round 3cm thick. Using the back of the knife, mark into wedges or squares. Brush dough with milk and bake for 15-20 mins until golden brown and firm when tapped.
3. Cool, then split and butter to serve.
