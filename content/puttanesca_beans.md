## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/2 white or yellow onion, finely diced
- 2 minced garlic cloves
- 3 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1 420g can diced fire-roasted tomatoes
- 1 cup low-sodium broth
- 2 420g white beans (navy beans, cannellini beans, great northern beans)
- 1/2 cup chopped kalamata olives
- 2 tablespoons capers
- 1/2 cup finely chopped parsley
- 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice or red wine vinegar
- 1/4 cup parmesan cheese (or vegan parmesan cheese)
- Garlic bread, for serving*

## Directions

1. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic until just fragrant.
2. Add in the tomato pasta, red pepper flakes and cook until slightly darkened, about 1 minute, and then add in the broth, tomatoes, white beans, olives and capers. Simmer over low heat and cook until thickened, about 10-15 minutes, stirring often.
3. Remove from heat and stir in the parsley, lemon juice and parmesan cheese. Stir and taste. You may likely not need additional salt because of the olives, capers and cheese.
4. Serve as is, with crusty garlic bread (my favorite!) or even spooned over polenta.
