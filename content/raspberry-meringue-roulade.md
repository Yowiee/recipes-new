## Ingredients

#### Meringue:
- Vegetable oil, for greasing
- 180g egg whites, cold (from about 5 large eggs)
- 225g caster sugar (1 1/8 cups)
- Zest of half a small lemon
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

#### Filling:
- 300ml thickened cream (1 1/4 cup)
- 115g mascarpone (1/2 cup), cold
- 30g icing sugar (1/4 cup)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/4 tsp rose water, optional
- 80g raspberry jam (1/4 cup)
- 250g fresh raspberries (2 cups)

#### Finish:
- 1 Tbsp toasted flaked almonds
- 1 tsp edible dried rose petals, optional
- Icing sugar, for dusting

## Directions

1.​ Preheat the oven to 160°C. Place a rack in the centre of the oven. Grease and line a 25 x 38 cm rimmed baking sheet with non-stick baking paper. Leave a few extra centimetres of the paper on each side of the tray (the meringue will spread as it cooks) and lightly brush the paper with a little vegetable oil.
2.In a clean and dry bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, or using a handheld electric whisk, whisk the egg whites on medium speed until soft peaks have begun to form, 4 to 5 minutes. Stream in the sugar, a little at a time, whisking well after each addition. Increase the speed to medium-high and continue to whisk until firm peaks have begun to form, about 3 more minutes. Add in the zest and salt. Continue to whisk until the mixture reaches stiff and glossy peaks, 3 to 4 more minutes.
3.Transfer the meringue into the prepared sheet. Use a large rubber spatula or offset palette knife to spread it all the way to the edges and into an even layer. Smooth out the top.
4.Bake for 13 to 15 minutes. The meringue should be firm around the edges, just set in the middle, and will have taken on some light golden brown colour on the top. Remove from the oven and set aside until cool enough to handle, 15 to 20 minutes. The meringue may have crackled and puffed during baking, which is normal. As it cools, it will begin to deflate and flatten out.
5.Place a large sheet of baking paper over the top of the meringue, then gently invert it out and onto a chopping board. Using the shortest edge, carefully roll the meringue over itself and into a taut log shape. The baking paper should be enclosed within its middle folds. Set aside, seam-side facing down, until completely cool, at least an hour or overnight.
6.When you're ready to assemble, make the filling. Beat together the cream and mascarpone until soft peaks have begun to form. Add in the sugar, vanilla and rose water, if using. Beat until the mixture has just formed firm peaks.
7.Carefully unroll the meringue and remove the layer of paper that covers it. It's OK if it cracks; the cream will hold everything together. Use an offset spatula or butter knife to spread three-quarters of the cream evenly over the top. Spread the raspberry jam over the cream, then scatter over three-quarters of the fresh raspberries.
8.Tightly but gently roll the meringue back into its original shape, using the bottom layer of baking paper to help you, then carefully transfer it onto a serving plate. Spread the remaining 1/4 of the cream down the middle of the roulade then top with the remaining raspberries. Scatter over the almonds and rose petals, if using. Set in the refrigerator to chill for at least another 30 minutes before serving.
9.When you're ready to serve, dust over a light flourish of the icing sugar before slicing. The roulade is best eaten on the day of making. It must be stored in the refrigerator at all times other than serving and can be kept for up to 3 days.
