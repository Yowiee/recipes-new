## Ingredients

- Vegetable oil spray, for greasing
- 250 g butternut snap biscuits (or other biscuits)
- 50 g desiccated coconut
- 80 g unsalted butter
- 150 g sweetened condensed milk
- 1 tsp vanilla bean paste
- 50 g good-quality dark chocolate, roughly chopped (see Note)
- 10 g freeze-dried raspberries, crushed

#### Chocolate topping
- 150 ml thickened cream
- 1 tbsp coconut oil
- 300 g good-quality milk chocolate
- 15 g desiccated coconut, for sprinkling
- 100 g fresh raspberries


## Directions

1. For the base: Grease a slice tin, 27.5 cm x 17.5 cm x 3.5 cm in size, and line with baking paper.
2. Blitz the biscuits until they resemble breadcrumbs. Combine the biscuit crumbs and coconut in a large bowl, then set aside.
3. Place the butter into a heat-proof bowl, then melt in the microwave. Add the condensed milk and vanilla to the melted butter and stir to combine.
4. Pour the butter mixture over the biscuit and coconut, then mix until the ingredients come to a wet sand consistency.
5. Add the dark chocolate and crushed freeze-dried raspberries and mix to incorporate.
6. Transfer into the prepared tin and push down firmly with the back of a spoon to create an even layer. Place into the refrigerator while you prepare the chocolate topping.
7. For the chocolate topping: Place the cream and coconut oil into a saucepan and bring to the boil.
8. Pour the hot liquids over the chocolate and whisk until the chocolate has completely melted and incorporated.
9. Pour the chocolate topping over the chilled slice and spread into an even layer. Before the topping sets, sprinkle with coconut and fresh raspberries.
10. Place into the refrigerator for 2 hours to set, then cut into pieces.
