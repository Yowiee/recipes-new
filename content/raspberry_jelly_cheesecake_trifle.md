## Ingredients

- 2 x 85g packet raspberry jelly crystals
- 625ml (2 1/2 cups) boiling water
- 375g fresh raspberries
- 8 savoiardi (sponge finger biscuits)
- 80ml (1/3 cup) raspberry liqueur
- 500g cream cheese, at room temperature
- 100g (1/2 cup) caster sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 600ml carton thickened cream
- 180g packet white chocolate, melted and cooled
- 250g carton crème fraîche
- 3 tsp rosewater
- Gold leaf, to decorate
- Chocolate stars, to decorate (see tips)

#### raspberry coulis
- 250g (2 cups) frozen raspberries
- 55g (1/4 cup) caster sugar

#### candied macadamias
- 55g (1/4 cup) caster sugar
- 80g (1/2 cup) unsalted roasted macadamias

## Directions

1. Place jelly crystals in a heatproof bowl. Pour in boiling water and stir until jelly crystals dissolve. Set aside for 1 hour to cool. Pour into a 20cm 3.75L (15 cup) straightsided trifle bowl. Add 250g raspberries. Place in the fridge for 4 hours to set.
2. Meanwhile, make the raspberry coulis. Place the frozen raspberries in a bowl and sprinkle with the sugar. Set aside for 2 hours until raspberries are thawed and sugar has dissolved. Use a fork to mash the raspberry mixture. Transfer to a fine sieve over a bowl. Use the back of a spoon to press as much juice as possible into the bowl. (You should have about 125ml/1/2 cup strained coulis.) Discard the seeds. Set aside.
3. Reserve half of the savoiardi. Cut the remaining savoiardi crossways into four pieces each. Place cut savoiardi around the edge of the trifle bowl, side by side. Fill the centre of the bowl with reserved savoiardi in a single layer, trimming to fit. Drizzle savoiardi with raspberry liqueur.
4. To make cheesecake filling, use electric beaters to beat the cream cheese, sugar, vanilla and 250ml (1 cup) of the cream in a bowl until smooth and well combined. Gradually beat in the white chocolate until well combined and thickened slightly. Spoon over the biscuit layer. Place into the fridge for 2 hours to chill.
5. To make the candied macadamias, line a baking tray with baking paper. Place the sugar in a small non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Cook for 2-3 minutes or until melted and golden. Add the macadamias and toss until well coated. Transfer to the lined tray. Set aside to cool and set.
6. Use electric beaters to beat crème fraîche, rosewater and remaining cream in a bowl until firm peaks form. Fold half of the coulis through the cream to create a marble effect. Spoon on top of the cheesecake layer. Drizzle the top with remaining raspberry coulis. Top with the chocolate stars, candied macadamias and remaining raspberries. Decorate with gold leaf.

#### Notes
1. Folding the cream through the cheesecake filling gives it a fluffy mousse-like texture.
1. Using a combination of crème fraîche and cream cuts through the sweetness and adds a slight tang.
1. Making toffee without water reduces the risk of your toffee crystallising.
1. You can buy ready-made small chocolate stars from the supermarket. For larger stars, either pipe or spread melted choc melts onto baking paper. Before completely set, use a star cutter to make an impression in the chocolate. Once fully set you can pop out the star
