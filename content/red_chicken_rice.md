## Ingredients

- 6 chicken thigh cutlets (bone-in)
- Salt and black pepper
- 1 tbsp smoked paprika
- 4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- 1 brown onion, finely chopped
- 1 red capsicum, finely chopped
- 4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
- 1 tbsp tomato paste
- 400 g tin diced tomatoes
- 2 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 2 tsp chicken stock powder
- 2 bay leaves
- 2 cups jasmine rice
- Â¼ cup finely chopped parsley, to serve
- Lemon wedges, to serve

## Directions

1. Season the chicken well on both sides with salt, black pepper and a little paprika.
2. Heat half the oil in a large, heavy-based frying pan over medium heat. Add the chicken and brown well on both sides, then remove to a plate. Add the remaining oil, onion, capsicum and garlic and season with a generous pinch of salt and cook, stirring, for 8 minutes, or until softened.
3. Add the tomato paste and tomatoes and cook for a further 5-10 minutes. Add the remaining paprika, cumin, oregano, chicken stock powder, bay leaves and rice and stir to coat the rice. Return the chicken to the pan, nestling the cutlets into the rice. Add 3 cups (750 ml) water and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and cook for 20-25 minutes, then remove from the heat and stand for a further 5 minutes, before removing the lid.
4. Serve the red chicken with rice, sprinkled with parsley and lemon wedges on the side.
