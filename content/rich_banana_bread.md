## Ingredients

- 1 cup white sugar (200g)
- ½ cup butter, melted (115g)
- 2 eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour (190g)
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup sour cream (120g)
- ½ cup chopped walnuts
- 2 medium bananas, mashed

## Directions

1. Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 175°C (165°C fan). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
2. Stir sugar and melted butter together in a large bowl. Add eggs and vanilla; mix well. Combine flour, baking soda, and salt; stir into butter mixture until smooth.
3. Fold in mashed banana, sour cream, and walnuts; transfer into the prepared pan.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean, about 1 hour.
5. Cool loaf in the pan for 10 minutes before inverting onto a wire rack to cool completely.
