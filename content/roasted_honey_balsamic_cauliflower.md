## Ingredients

- 1 large head cauliflower, trimmed and cut into 2-inch florets (8 cups)
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground pepper
- ½ cup all purpose flour
- ½ cup whole milk
- 2 tablespoons balsamic glaze
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme leaves

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 220°C. Generously coat a large rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray.
2. Toss cauliflower, oil, mustard, garlic powder, salt and pepper together in a large bowl until well combined. Whisk flour and milk together in a small bowl until a smooth batter forms. Pour the batter over the cauliflower; toss until evenly coated. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet.
3. Bake until the batter is lightly golden and the cauliflower is fork-tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, whisk balsamic glaze and honey together in a small bowl.
5. Transfer the cauliflower to a large bowl; drizzle with the honey-balsamic glaze and toss to coat. Transfer to a platter and sprinkle with thyme.
