## Ingredients

- 1.25kg Queensland Blue pumpkin, peeled, deseeded, cut into 2cm pieces
- 2 tsp extra virgin olive oil
- 1 red onion, finely chopped
- 500g button mushrooms, sliced
- 2 garlic cloves, crushed
- 1 tbsp Tomato Paste
- 400g Chopped Tomatoes
- 100g chargrilled capsicum, drained, finely chopped
- 60ml (1/4 cup) water
- 240g (1 cup) fresh ricotta
- 1 egg
- 60ml (1/4 cup) milk
- 25g (1/3 cup) parmesan, finely grated
- 3 large zucchini, trimmed
- 80g baby spinach leaves

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 180C/160C fan forced. Line a baking tray with baking paper. Place pumpkin in a single layer on prepared tray. Spray with olive oil. Roast for 30 minutes or until golden and tender. Transfer to a bowl. Roughly mash with a fork.
2. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook onion, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes or until soft. Add the mushrooms and cook for 3-4 minutes or until browned. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds or until aromatic. Stir in tomato paste. Cook for 1 minute. Add the tomato, capsicum and water. Simmer for 10 minutes or until thick.
3. Spray a 2L (8 cup) ovenproof dish with olive oil. Combine ricotta, egg, milk and half the parmesan in a bowl. Whisk until smooth. Cut long slices from zucchini using a vegetable peeler, discarding centre core.
4. To assemble, place a third of the zucchini slices, slightly overlapping, in base of prepared dish. Top with half the pumpkin, half the spinach and half the mushroom mixture. Repeat layers of zucchini, pumpkin, spinach and mushroom mixture. Finish with a layer of zucchini. Spread evenly with ricotta mixture. Sprinkle with remaining parmesan.
5. Bake for 25 minutes or until top is golden and bubbling. Stand for 5 minutes before serving.
