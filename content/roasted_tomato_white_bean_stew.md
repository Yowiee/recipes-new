## Ingredients

- ½ cup roughly chopped Italian parsley leaves and tender stems
- 2 teaspoons lemon zest (from 1 large lemon)
- 2 300g containers cherry or grape tomatoes
- ¼ cup olive oil, plus 2 tablespoons and more for drizzling (optional)
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
- Salt and black pepper
- 1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced
- 3 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced
- ½ teaspoon red-pepper flakes
- ½ teaspoon dried sage
- 2 cans white beans (such as butter or cannellini), rinsed
- 1½ cups vegetable or chicken broth, or water
- 2 tbs tomatoe paste
- 100g baby spinach leaves
- Flaky salt, for serving (optional)
- Toasted bread, for serving

## Directions

1. Heat the oven to 220°C. In a small bowl, gently toss together the parsley and lemon zest with your hands until well combined; set aside.
2: In a large baking dish or on a sheet pan, toss the tomatoes with ¼ cup oil and thyme; season well with salt and pepper. Roast tomatoes until they have collapsed and begin to turn golden around the edges, 20 to 25 minutes.
3: When the tomatoes are almost done roasting, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large (12-inch), deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium. Add the onion, garlic, sage and red-pepper flakes and cook until the onion is softened and the garlic is fragrant, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the tomatoe paste, rinsed beans and broth and bring to a simmer. With the back of a spoon or spatula, gently smash about ½ cup of the beans so they slightly thicken the broth. If you want a thicker stew, crush some more of the beans. Season with salt and pepper.
4: When the tomatoes are finished roasting, add them directly to the stew along with any juices that have been released, and spinach leaves. Simmer for 5 to 10 minutes more so the flavors become friendly; season to taste with salt.
5: Ladle into shallow bowls. Top each serving with some of the lemon-parsley mixture and drizzle with more olive oil, and season with flaky salt, if you like. Serve with toasted bread.
