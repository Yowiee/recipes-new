## Ingredients

- 225g unsalted butter, softened
- 220g (1cup, firmly packed) brown sugar
- 3 large eggs
- 1½ tsp vanilla extract
- 225g (1½ cups) plain flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- ½ tsp baking soda
- 125g (½ cup) sour cream

#### For the syrup
- 100ml dark rum
- 100g (½ cup, lightly packed) brown sugar.

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 175˚C. Grease and flour a 21cm, 6 cup-capacity bundt or ring tin.
2. Using electric beaters, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well between each. Add the vanilla.
3. Sift together the flour, baking powder and baking soda, then stir the mixture into the creamed mixture, alternating with large spoonfuls of the sour cream.
4. Spoon the mixture into the prepared tin, smoothing the top even.
5. Bake for 1 hour or until a cake tester withdraws clean.
6. Meanwhile for the rum syrup, combine the rum and sugar with 100ml water in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer. Cook over medium heat for 3-4 minutes or until reduced and thickened slightly. Set aside.
7. When the cake is ready, use a wooden skewer to poke holes into the cake while it is still in the tin, then pour over the syrup.
8. Cool the cake in the tin, then turn out onto a plate to serve.
