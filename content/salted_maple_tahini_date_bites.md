## Ingredients

#### For the base:
- 1 cup almond meal
- 1 tablespoon coconut oil, melted
- 1 cup (180g) Medjool dates, approximately 10
- ¼ teaspoon salt

#### For the salted maple tahini filling:
- 1 cup hulled tahini
- ½ cup pure maple syrup
- ⅓ cup coconut oil
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon salt

#### For the chocolate layer:
- 100g dark chocolate, I used 70% dark chocolate
- 1 tablespoon coconut oil

## Directions

1 Preheat the oven to 175°C conventional or 155°C if using fan-forced (see tips above if you're unsure). Line a square 20cm x 20cm baking tin with baking paper that overhangs the sides, so you can lift the slice out later, and set aside.
2 For the base: Place all ingredients in a food processor and blitz till you have a sandy mixture. If you don't have a food processor, finely chop the dates, mix with remaining base ingredients and press into the tin. Using a palette knife/offset spatula to do this step helps make a flat, even biscuit layer. The back of a spoon works great too.
3 Bake the biscuit base for 15 minutes or until light golden-brown on the edges. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 5 minutes.
4 For the maple salted tahini filling: Place all ingredients into a microwave-safe bowl/jug and heat for 30 seconds. Mix until smooth and taste to see whether you need more salt or not.
5 In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the dark chocolate and coconut oil for 30 second increments until fully melted (a total of 1 minute should do it!).
6 Time to assemble: Pour the salted maple tahini filling over the slightly cooled biscuit base. Spoon the melted chocolate on top and, using the back of a spoon, create dramatic swirls on top. This will give the tahini bars a wonderful swirl pattern in the layers when you slice it.
7 Place in the fridge and allow to chill for at least 4 hours or, even better, overnight.
8 Using a hot, sharp knife, cut 30 bite sized pieces of the slice and store in an airtight container in the fridge. Enjoy! These bites will keep in the fridge for up to 2 weeks, or in the freezer for 3 months (if they last that long!).
