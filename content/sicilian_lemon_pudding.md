## Ingredients

- 3/4 cup granulated sugar (150g)
- 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon lemon zest (from 3 lemons)
- 5 tablespoons cornstarch (45g)
- 3 large eggs
- 1 cup lemon juice (240ml) (from 4 to 5 lemons)
- 2 1/2 cups water (600ml)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Fresh berries, to serve

## Directions

1. Get ready. Place a fine-mesh sieve over a large bowl and set it next to the stove.
2. Mix the dry ingredients. In a large mixing bowl, combine the sugar, salt, and lemon zest. Use your fingers to rub the zest into the sugar until the sugar is pale yellow and the zest is evenly distributed throughout. Stir in the cornstarch.
3. Beat in the eggs. Add the eggs and beat on medium-high speed with a hand mixer until the mixture is pale and foamy, 2 to 3 minutes.
4. Make the pudding. Pour the egg mixture into a large saucepan. Whisk in the lemon juice and water. Set the pan over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until it reaches a gentle simmer, 12 to 15 minutes. Then, cook for an additional minute.
5. Strain the pudding. Remove the pan from the heat and pour the pudding through the sieve and into the large bowl.
6. Portion and chill. Pour the pudding into glasses or small bowls, about 2/3 cup per portion for 6 servings or 1/2 cup per portion for 8 servings. Cover with plastic wrap directly on the surface of the pudding to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours until thickened and thoroughly chilled.
7. Finish and serve. Garnish with fresh berries and serve.
