## Ingredients

- 1¾ cups (210 g) all purpose flour
- ¼ cup (30 g) cornstarch
- 2½ tsp baking powder
- ½ tsp salt - omit if using salted butter
- ½ cup (113 g) unsalted butter - room temperature
- ¼ cup (52 g) unflavored vegetable oil - I use canola oil
- 1¼ cups (250 g) white granulated sugar
- 1½ tbsp lemon zest - about 1 and 1/2 lemons zested (see note 1)
- 2 large eggs - room temperature
- ⅔ cup (165 g) yoghurt - unflavored and unsweetened, regular and Greek will both work (though I prefer to use regular).
- 3 tbsp (40 g) lemon juice - freshly squeezed
- 1 tsp vanilla essence/extract
- 2 cups (330 g) fresh blueberries (divided in half) - Coat one half of the blueberries in 1 tbsp of flour and leave the rest as is. See note 2 if you want to use frozen blueberries.
- Powdered sugar - for dusting on top

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 180 °C (350°F) conventional (see note 3 if using a convection oven with a fan) and grease a 9-inch springform cake tin (I use my homemade cake release). Line the bottom with parchment paper as well.
2. Sift together flour, cornstarch, baking powder and salt. Mix together using a whisk and set aside.
3. In a large bowl add in butter, vegetable oil, sugar and lemon zest. Using a hand or stand mixer on a medium speed, cream together for 2 minutes until light and creamy.
4. Add in the eggs one by one, mixing well in between each addition.
5. Add in yoghurt, lemon juice and vanilla. Mix until well combined. Now set your mixer aside as the remainder of the batter will be finished by hand.
6. Add your pre-sifted dry ingredients to your wet mixture, and using a spatula, fold together until just combined. Do not overmix.
7. Toss half of the blueberries in a tablespoon of flour (this will prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the cake) and then add the coated blueberries to the batter and fold them in with a spatula until just combined. Do not overmix.
8. Distribute the batter evenly into the prepared cake pan. Scatter the remaining half of the blueberries evenly across the top of the cake. Drop the cake tin lightly on the counter to remove any large air bubbles and bake for 55 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs on it.
9. Allow the cake to cool in the tin for 20 minutes, before removing the outer ring of the springform pan. Allow the cake to completely cool before removing the base and parchment paper (see video for tips on how I do this).
10. Dust the top with powdered sugar and serve as is, or with a side of whipped cream or ice cream. Enjoy!
