## Ingredients

- 450 g dried rice vermicelli noodles
- 6 tbsp vegetable oil
- 2 chicken thigh fillets, thinly sliced
- 1 small carrot, thinly sliced
- 1 red capsicum, thinly sliced
- 2 garlic cloves, roughly chopped
- 1 cm x 2 cm piece ginger, finely chopped
- 3 eggs, beaten
- 2 tsp curry powder
- 1 tsp chicken stock powder (or ½ tsp MSG)
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- ½ tsp caster sugar
- 4 thick spring onions, thinly sliced on the diagonal
- 80 g bean sprouts

## Directions

1. Place the dried rice vermicelli noodles into a large bowl and cover with boiling water. Allow to stand for 5 minutes, then drain well.
2. Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in a large wok or frying pan over high heat. Add the chicken and stir-fry for 1 minute, followed by the carrot, capsicum, garlic and ginger. Stir-fry for a further 1-2 minutes, or until the vegetables are softened. Remove the contents of the pan to a plate, then return the pan to the heat with the remaining oil.
3. Add the beaten eggs to the oil and stir the eggs vigorously in the oil to form threads, then add the drained vermicelli rice noodles. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes, or until the noodles are lightly toasted. Return the fried ingredients from the plate to the pan with the curry powder, stock powder, salt, soy sauce and sugar. Toss everything together well, adding a splash of water to the pan if you need. Toss through the spring onion (reserve a little to garnish!) and bean sprouts for 1 minute, until slightly softened.
4. Transfer the Singapore chicken noodles to a large serving plate, sprinkle with the reserved spring onion and serve.
