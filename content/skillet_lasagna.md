## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1/2 cup small-diced yellow onion (about 1/2 small onion)
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 250g beef mince
- 250g spicy Italian sausage
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 680g jar marinara or arrabbiata sauce
- 1/3 cup, plus 1/4 cup store-bought basil pesto
- Grated zest of half a lemon
- 180g no-boil oven-ready lasagna sheets
- 250g fresh mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced
- Fresh basil leaves, for serving

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 190°C (180°C fan).
2. In a 10-inch ovenproof skillet (preferably cast-iron), heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring, until the onion is tender, about 3 minutes. Add the ground beef and sausage. Continue to cook, breaking up the meat with the edge of a spoon, until it is browned and cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes.
3. Drain off the excess fat, then add the salt, pepper, arrabbiata sauce, 1/3 cup of the pesto, and the lemon zest and stir to combine. Bring to a simmer and reduce the heat to medium-low.
4. Carefully break up the lasagna noodles into 1- to 2-inch pieces and add them to the skillet. Don't worry if they get a little jagged and imperfect, it will still come together nicely. Gently fold the noodles into the sauce to ensure they are coated in the sauce, then use the back of a spatula to spread the contents of the skillet into an even layer.
5. Place the mozzarella slices evenly across the top of the skillet in a single layer, then dollop small spoonfuls of the remaining 1/4 cup pesto across the top. Carefully cover the skillet with aluminum foil, ensuring the foil does not touch the top of the lasagna.
6. Bake for 15 minutes. Carefully remove the foil and continue to bake, uncovered, until the cheese is golden, 10 to 12 more minutes.
7. Remove the lasagna from the oven and let cool, uncovered, for 8 to 10 minutes to allow the sauce to settle and thicken a bit more. Top with the basil and serve.
