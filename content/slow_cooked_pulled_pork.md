## Ingredients

- 1 small yellow onion finely chopped
- 170 g tomato paste
- ⅓ cup apple cider vinegar
- ⅓ cup honey
- ¼ cup water
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
- 2 teaspoons garlic powder
- 2 teaspoons mustard powder
- 2 teaspoons Sriracha or hot sauce of choice
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt plus additional for the pork
- 1 teaspoon liquid smoke optional but super good
- 1.5 - 2 kg boneless pork shoulder or pork butt
- Ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons cornflour

## Directions

1. In the bottom of a 6 liter or larger slow cooker, whisk together the onion, tomato paste, apple cider vinegar, honey, water, brown sugar, Worcestershire, smoked paprika, garlic powder, mustard powder, sriracha, 1 teaspoon salt, and liquid smoke (if using), until smoothly combined.
2. Cut the fat from the bottom of the pork. Season the pork all over with a generous amount of kosher salt and ground pepper.
3. Add the pork to the slow cooker and spoon the sauce all over the top to cover it.
4. Cover the slow cooker and cook on HIGH for 5 to 6 hours or LOW for 8 to 10 hours, until the pork is fall-apart tender. Transfer the pork to a large bowl, leaving the cooking liquid in the slow cooker.
5. In a small bowl, stir together the cornflour with 3 tablespoons cold water to create a slurry. Pour into the slow cooker, then whisk to combine. Cover the slow cooker and cook on HIGH, whisking every so often, until the sauce is thickened to your liking, about 20 to 30 minutes.
6. While the sauce thickens, shred the pork with two forks or, if it is cool enough to handle, with your fingers.
7. Stir the shredded pork back into the thickened sauce in the slow cooker. Taste and adjust seasoning as desired (you may need an extra pinch of salt or some additional hot sauce if you enjoy a kick). Spoon pork on top of buns with coleslaw and pickles to create a sandwich, or serve it any way you like.
