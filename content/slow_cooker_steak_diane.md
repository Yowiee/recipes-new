## Ingredients

- 1kg beef rump steak
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 brown onions sliced
- 3 cloves garlic
- 200g button mushrooms, sliced
- 1/2 cup Massel Chicken Style Liquid Stock
- 1/2 cup cream
- 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tbsp Dijon mustard

## Directions

1. Trim fat from steak and cut into large pieces. Heat oil in a frypan over high heat. Brown steak well on both sides, seasoning well with salt and pepper.
2. Place onion in the base of a slow cooker and top with browned steak. Sprinkle over garlic and mushrooms. Combine stock, cream, Worcestershire and mustard in a jug and pour over steak. Cover with a lid and cook on high for 4-5 hours until the meat is tender. Remove the lid for the last 30 minutes to help thicken sauce.
