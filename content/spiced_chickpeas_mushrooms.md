## Ingredients

#### Mushrooms
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 500g button mushrooms, sliced 5mm thick
- ½ tsp cooking salt
- ¼ tsp black pepper

#### Stew
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, finely minced
- 1 tbsp baharat powder – see note
- 2 tsp cumin powder
- ½ tsp coriander powder
- ¼ tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 x 400g can chickpeas, drained
- 1 x 400g can crushed tomato
- 1½ cups salt-reduced vegetable stock
- ½ tsp cooking salt
- ¼ cup roughly chopped parsley
- extra virgin olive oil to serve
- warm flatbreads to serve

## Directions

1. To cook the mushrooms, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large, deep pan over high heat. Add half the mushrooms and half the salt and pepper and cook for 5 minutes until the mushrooms are lightly golden. Remove the mushrooms from the pan and place in a bowl. Add another tablespoon of oil and cook the remaining mushrooms, salt and pepper. Add to the bowl and set aside.
2. To cook the stew, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil in the same pan. Cook the onion and garlic until the onion is translucent. Return the mushrooms to the pan and add the spices. Stir for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the chickpeas, tomato, stock, and salt. Simmer on medium-low without a lid for 15 minutes until thickened. Stir through most of the parsley. Taste and add more salt if desired.
3. Divide the stew among four bowls, drizzle on some extra virgin olive oil, and sprinkle with the remaining chopped parsley. Serve with warm flatbreads.
