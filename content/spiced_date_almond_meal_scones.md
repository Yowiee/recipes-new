## Ingredients

- 2 cups (200g) almond meal
- ½ cup (60g) arrowroot
- 2 tsp gluten-free baking powder
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon, plus extra for dusting
- 1 tsp ground ginger
- ⅛ tsp ground cloves
- pinch Himalayan salt
- ¼ cup (60g) coconut oil, frozen solid so you can grate it, plus extra for greasing
- 8 medjool dates, pitted and coarsely chopped
- ¼ cup (60ml) coconut drinking milk, plus extra for brushing
- 2 large eggs, separated
- 1 tbsp raw honey
- finely grated zest of 1 unwaxed orange

## Directions

- Preheat the oven to 200°C. Lightly grease and line a large baking tray (cookie sheet) with baking paper.
- Combine the almond meal, arrowroot, baking powder, ground spices and salt in a medium bowl and stir to combine. Coarsely grate in the frozen coconut oil. Add the dates and stir to distribute through the dry mixture.
- Whisk the coconut milk, egg yolks, honey and orange zest together in a small bowl. Add to the dry mixture and stir to form a lumpy dough.
- Whisk the egg whites in a medium bowl until stiff peaks form.
- Stir a large spoonful of egg white into the dough, to loosen. Gently fold through the remaining egg whites to make a thick, sticky dough.
- Place the dough in the centre of the prepared tray. Using slightly wet hands shape and press the dough to make a 3cm-thick disc.
- Using a large wet knife, mark the disc into 8 portions, pressing the knife halfway down through the dough. Brush the top with coconut milk and dust with cinnamon.
- Bake for 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from the oven, cover with a clean tea towel (dish towel) and set aside for 10 minutes to cool slightly.
- Remove the tea towel (dish towel) and cut into portions. Serve warm or at room temperature.
