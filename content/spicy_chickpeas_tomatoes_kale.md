## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons grapeseed, olive, or other neutral oil
- 1/2 small yellow or white onion, finely chopped, about 1/2 cup
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1-inch piece ginger, peeled and minced
- crushed red pepper flakes to taste (I use 1/2 teaspoon or less)
- salt and pepper to taste
- 3 tablespoons curry powder, I love Madras brand
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 2 420g cans, drained and rinsed
- 400g can diced tomatoes or 1 lb. diced fresh tomatoes (about 2 cups)
- 1 cup water or vegetable stock (I always use water)
- 2 to 4 cups stemmed and chopped fresh kale
- 1 teaspoon miso, optional, see notes above
- 1/4 cup (or more) unsweetened coconut milk

## Directions

1. In a large skillet set over medium-low heat, combine the oil, onion, garlic, ginger, red pepper flakes, pinch salt, and black pepper to taste. Cook until slightly softened, 4 to 5 minutes.
2. Add the curry powder, and stir, coating it in the aromatics and toasting it a bit, another 2 to 4 minutes. Add the tomato paste, stirring it into the curry-coated aromatics, and cook for another minute or until the red color darkens and it smells toasty. Add the chickpeas and stir to coat them in the curry mixture. Cook for another two minutes or until the chickpeas are evenly coated in the spices; then taste a chickpea for seasoning. Adjust accordingly if it needs more salt or pepper to taste. 
3. Add the tomatoes and water (or stock) and simmer for 10 minutes or until everything is warmed through. Add more water as needed if it looks too thick â€” chickpeas can absorb a ton of liquid. Add the kale and cook until wilted.
4. If using the miso, stir it into 1/4 cup warm water and add it to the skillet along with the coconut milk. Stir to combine and cook for another minute or two. As noted above, I add more like 3/4 cup coconut milk and use another 3/4 cup coconut milk for this coconut rice. 
5. Serve with rice or naan, a lime wedge, and a sprinkle of cilantro, if you wish.
