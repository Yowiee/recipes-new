## Ingredients

#### Mazemen

- Canola or vegetable oil
- 8 ounces mushrooms (such as cremini, button or shiitake), sliced
- Salt and pepper
- 400 - 450g package extra firm tofu, drained and crumbled into ½-inch chunks
- 4 baby bok choy, each trimmed and cut into 4 pieces through the stem
- 340g dried ramen noodles
- 2 scallions, thinly sliced

#### Sauce
- ¼ cup Chinese or Japanese sesame paste, or tahini
- 8 teaspoons chile crisp
- 4 teaspoons white (shiro) miso paste
- 4 teaspoons soy sauce
- Just-boiled water

## Directions

1. Prepare the mazemen: Heat a large skillet on medium-high. When hot, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of oil, along with the mushrooms. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, tossing occasionally, until the mushrooms have softened, with golden edges, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the pan.
2. Drizzle the pan with another 2 tablespoons of oil, add the tofu and cook over medium-high, tossing occasionally, until golden, 5 to 7 minutes. (The tofu will break up more as you toss it, which is fine.)
3. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the baby bok boy and cook for 1½ to 2 minutes, until the stems are just tender and the leaves are bright green. Using tongs, remove the greens from the water and place in a colander.
4. To the same pot of water, add the ramen noodles and cook according to packet instructions, until just tender.
5. Meanwhile make the sauce: In a large bowl, add the sesame paste, chile crisp, miso paste, soy sauce and ½ cup just-boiled water; whisk to combine.
6. Drain the noodles. Add them to the sauce and, using tongs or chopsticks, toss everything together until the noodles are coated. (If the sauce is very thick, add another tablespoon or two of just-boiled water to help loosen up the noodles.)
7. Divide the noodles evenly among serving bowls and top each with the baby bok choy, mushrooms and tofu. Top with scallions, toss everything together and serve immediately.
