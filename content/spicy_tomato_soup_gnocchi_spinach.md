## Ingredients

- 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 large yellow onions, halved and thinly sliced 
- 10 garlic cloves, smashed and finely chopped
- 1 ½ teaspoons crushed red pepper
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 800g can crushed tomatoes 
- 3 sprigs or ½ cup packed fresh basil
- 4 cups vegetable stock 
- 450g gnocchi
- 250g bag frozen chopped spinach
- 1/3 cup heavy cream 
- Salt
- Granulated sugar, if needed 

## Directions

1. In a large pot over high heat, combine the oil and onions. Cook, stirring frequently, until the onions turn light brown with frizzled edges, 10 minutes. Halfway through cooking, deglaze the pan with ⅓ cup water, adjusting the heat if the onions are browning too quickly. 
2. Reserve 2 teaspoons of the chopped garlic. Reduce the heat to medium, add the remaining garlic to the pot along with the crushed red pepper and cumin, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes, until fragrant. 
3. Stir in the crushed tomatoes and basil, and bring to a boil over high. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 6 minutes, until the mixture has thickened slightly.
4. Add the stock and bring to a boil. Scrape the caramelized bits off the sides of the pot into the liquid. Reduce the heat to medium or medium-high and vigorously simmer for 12 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
5. Using tongs or a fork, remove the basil. Add the gnocchi, spinach and reserved chopped garlic, and boil, raising the heat if needed, until the gnocchi is cooked through and the spinach is wilted, about 3 minutes. Turn off the heat. 
6. Stir in the cream. Taste and gradually season with salt, to preference. If needed, add about 1 tablespoon of sugar to balance out the acidity of the tomatoes. (The soup lasts for a few days in the fridge and can be reheated in a pot, with a splash of water to thin it out.)
