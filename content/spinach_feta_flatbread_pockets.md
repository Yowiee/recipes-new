## Ingredients

#### Flatbread dough
- 400g self raising flour
- 340g plain Greek yoghurt

#### Spinach and feta filling
- 100g feta cheese, crumbled
- 2 tbsp cream cheese
- 1 tbsp fresh mint, finely chopped
- 250g frozzen spinach, defrosted, squeezed of liquid and chopped
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- Freshly ground pepper to taste

## Directions

#### For the flatbread dough

1. Add flour and yoghurt to a stand mixer bowl. With a dough hook attached, combine ingredients. Once combined allow the dough hook to knead the dough for a further 5 minutes. 
2. The dough should be a lovely soft texture. Add a little more flour if too sticky.
3. Make the dough into a ball and cover with loose cling film for approximately 1 hour.
4. Once rested, knead by hand for a further minute. Divide into 8 balls.

#### For the spinach and feta filling 

1. Combine all ingredients in a small bowl ensuring there is no excess liquid in the mixture.
2. Once well combined, set aside until the flatbread dough is ready to fill.

#### For the flatbread pocket assembling

1. Preheat the pizza oven to 300Â°C.
2. Take one dough ball and roll out to a round 1cm thickness. 
3. Place 1 large tablespoon of filling in the middle of the dough. Bring all of the edges together to the centre, covering the filling to make a sealed parcel.
4. Turn the parcel over so the join is face down. Flatten the parcel gently with the palm of your hand so the pocket is approximately 1.5cm to 2cm thick. Place on a lightly floured surface and cover with loose cling film.
5. Repeat steps with the remaining dough. To cook, place 2 at a time on the preheated pizza oven stone. Close the lid and cook for 3 minutes. The dough will be a lovely golden brown when ready.
6. Serve with a dipping sauce of your choice.

#### Notes
Tip: This dough is the easiest two ingredient dough to make. You can also try sweet fillings like cooked apple or pear with a bit of sugar and spice. Delicious served with ice cream.
