## Ingredients

- 2 small green apples
- 100g caster sugar 
- 190g stoned dates 
- 500ml water
- 2 tsp bicarbonate of soda
- 90g butter, at room temperature
- 300g dark brown sugar 
- 3 eggs 
- 300g self-raising flour 
- ½ tsp ground ginger 

#### To serve
- butterscotch sauce and vanilla ice cream


## Directions

1. To make the caramel apples, peel, quarter and core the apples, then cut each quarter into 3 segments.
2. Put the sugar and 50g of water in a wide saucepan over a low heat. Stir until the sugar melts, then turn up the heat and boil, without stirring, until it goes a dark golden colour and smells caramelly.
3. Carefully add the sliced apple and cook until the apple starts to soften, about 4-5 minutes. Remove from the heat.
4. Preheat the oven to 160°C fan. Grease a loaf tin and line the base with greaseproof paper.
5. Put the dates and the 500ml of water into a saucepan, bring to the boil, then simmer until the dates are very soft, about 5 minutes. Leave to cool, then add the bicarbonate of soda and mash the dates in the water.
6. Meanwhile, cream the butter and sugar in a stand mixer with the paddle attachment. One at a time, whisk the eggs into the creamed sugar and butter.
7. Add the date mixture to the creamed butter and eggs mixture, then fold in the flour and ginger. Pour the batter into the loaf tin and bake for 55 minutes.
8. Remove from the oven and place the caramel apple slices on top, then bake for another 15 minutes, or until a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean.
9. Leave to cool in the tin for 15 minutes, then turn out on to a rack and cool completely. Serve with butterscotch sauce and vanilla ice-cream.
