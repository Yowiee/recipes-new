## Ingredients

#### Mug cake mixture
- 1 cups (150 g) self-raising flour
- 1 cups (200 g) caster sugar
- 1/4 cup (55 g) dark brown sugar
- 1/2 cup Dutch-process cocoa powder

#### For each mug cake
- ½ cup mug cake mix (above)
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- ¼ cup (60 ml) milk
- ¼ cup (60 ml) boiling water
- Vanilla ice cream and berries, to serve

## Directions

1. Combine the ingredients for the mug cake mixture in a large zip lock bag and mix gently to combine.
2. To make each individual mug cake, combine ½ cup of the prepared mug cake mixture in a large mug (or small bowl) with the oil and milk. Whisk to a thick batter, then pour over the boiling water. 
3. Microwave at 1000W for 90 seconds, then remove and allow to stand for 30 seconds. Serve the super soft chocolate mug cake with ice cream and berries. Repeat for as many serves as you like.

#### Note
- The cake mixture will rise as it cooks in the microwave, so choose a mug or bowl with plenty of room to prevent it from overflowing!
