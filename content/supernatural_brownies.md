## Ingredients

- 250g butter, more for pan and parchment paper
- 220g bittersweet chocolate
- 1 cup dark brown sugar
- 1 cup raw sugar
- 4 eggs
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 cup flour
- ½ cup chopped walnuts or ¾ cup whole walnuts, optional
	
## Directions

1. Butter a 30x20 cm lamington tin and line with buttered parchment paper. Preheat oven to 170°C. In top of a double boiler set over barely simmering water, or on low power in a microwave, melt butter, chocolate and sugars together. Cool slightly. In a large bowl or mixer, whisk eggs. Whisk in salt and vanilla.
2. Whisk in chocolate mixture. Fold in flour just until combined. If using chopped walnuts, stir them in. Pour batter into prepared pan. If using whole walnuts, arrange on top of batter. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until shiny and beginning to crack on top. Cool in pan on rack.

#### Tip
- For best flavor, bake 1 day before serving, let cool and store, tightly wrapped.
