## Ingredients

#### SWEET POTATO LOAF
- 230 g all-purpose flour
- 100 g granulated sugar
- 150 g dark brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- ¼ teaspoon ground allspice
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 300 g baked sweet potato puree room temperature (see FAQ on how to bake the sweet potato and it in advance)
- 110 g vegetable oil room temperature
- 2 eggs room temperature
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

#### CREAM CHEESE FROSTING
- 100 g butter
- 50 g full-fat cream cheese
- 180 g powdered sugar sifted
- ½ teaspoon vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract

## Directions

#### SWEET POTATO LOAF
1. Preheat the oven at 175ºC/350ºF conventional oven and grease a 21,5 x 11,5 cm /8,5x4,5 inch loaf pan lined with parchment paper.
2. In a large bowl, stir together the all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, dark brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, spices and salt. Give it a stir to make sure everything has been combined.
3. Add the baked sweet potato to a food processor and blend it until a smooth texture. Weigh out the puree and add it to a separate mixing bowl.
4. Add the vegetable oil, eggs and vanilla extra to the sweet potato puree and with a hand whisk, whisk it together until combined.
5. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry while stirring it all together with a hand whisk or rubber spatula. Make sure there is no lumps left in the batter.
6. Pour the cake batter into the prepared loaf pan. Take a butter knife and insert it into the top of the batter in the loaf pan and run it a straight line down the middle.
7. Bake it for 1 hour and 5-15 minutes or until a cake tester comes out clean. Let the cake cool on a wire rack. After 10 minutes, gently remove the cake from the loaf pan and let it cool down completely.

#### CREAM CHEESE FROSTING
1. Once the sweet potato bread is completely cooled down, take the butter and cream cheese out of the fridge 10 minutes before starting. Cut the butter into cubes. Sift the powdered sugar.
2. In your stand mixer, using the paddle attachment or using a hand mixer, start by creaming the butter for 5 minutes on high speed. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and give it another mix for 2 minutes.
3. Add the vanilla bean paste and cream cheese and cream it together with the butter for 1 minute.
4. ½ teaspoon vanilla bean paste
5. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and add the sifted powdered sugar in 2 parts, letting the powdered sugar mix in with butter and cream cheese, on low speed, before adding the next part. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and give it a final mix for 1 minutes.
6. Add the cream cheese frosting on top of the loaf cake and event it out.
