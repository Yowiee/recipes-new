## Ingredients

- ground almonds 150g
- baking powder 1 tsp
- fine sea salt ¼ tsp
- tahini 100g
- honey 90g (or agave or vegan “honey”)
- sesame seeds 15g, a mixture of black and white, ideally

## Directions

1. Preheat your oven to 160C fan/gas mark 4. Line two baking sheets with greaseproof paper. Whisk together the ground almonds, baking powder and sea salt. Add the tahini and honey and beat together until smooth.
2. Place the sesame seeds in a bowl or on a small plate. Divide the mixture into 12 and roll into balls in your hand. Roll each ball lightly in the sesame seeds and place on the lined baking sheet. Leave a good few centimetres between them as they can spread.
3. Press down a little on each ball to flatten slightly. Bake in the oven for 8-10 minutes, or until the biscuits are lightly golden around the edge. Leave to cool on the tray for 5 minutes then transfer to a cooling rack.
