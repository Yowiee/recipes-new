## Ingredients

- 1.2 kg boneless chicken thighs
- 2 Tbsp Thai Yellow Curry Paste
- 200 ml Coconut Cream
- 1 Tbsp Fish Sauce
- 1 Tbsp Sweet Chilli Sauce
- 1 onion, chopped into small wedges
- 2 cups jasmine rice
- 3 cups low salt chicken stock
- Salt and pepper

#### Garnish (optional)
- Coriander, chopped
- 2 red chillies, sliced
- Crispy fried shallots
- 1/2 lime, squeezed over

## Directions

1. Score chicken thighs and place in a bowl. Add Thai Yellow Curry Paste, Coconut Cream, Fish Sauce and Sweet Chilli Sauce. Mix well to ensure chicken is well coated. Set aside to marinate.
2. Preheat oven to 200°C.
3. In a baking tray, add and mix together the jasmine rice and chicken stock.
4. Lay marinated chicken thighs and sliced onions on top of the rice. Brush any excess marinade on top of the chicken and drizzle oil on top to help with browning.
