## Ingredients

#### For the cookies:

- 125g unsalted butter, softened
- 2 tablespoons honey
- ¾ cup (150g) brown sugar
- 1 egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3 tablespoons instant coffee powder, dissolved in 2 tablespoons boiling water (see tips above if you want the coffee flavour to be stronger)
- 2 ¾ cups (340g) plain flour, sifted
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt

#### For the mascarpone icing:

- 125g mascarpone, chilled
- 2 tablespoon pure icing sugar, sifted 
- Cocoa powder, for dusting

## Directions

1. In a large bowl (or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment), beat the butter, honey and brown sugar until pale and creamy. Add the egg and vanilla extract, beating until well combined. Add coffee bit by bit until fully incorporated.
2. In a separate bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt together. Add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture and fold until a soft dough forms. Chill for 30 minutes or overnight to make it easier to roll.
3. Preheat oven to 160°C fan-forced or 180°C conventional. Line two baking trays with paper. Roll the chilled dough into 3cm balls (about 45g each) and arrange on trays, leaving room to spread (about 5-7cm between cookies). I like to flatten the balls slightly so they are about 5-6cm wide by 1cm thick.
4. Bake for 14–16 minutes, swapping trays halfway, until just set. Cool on trays for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.
5. To make the icing, mix the mascarpone and icing sugar until smooth. Spread onto cooled cookies. Dust lightly with cocoa and enjoy

#### Notes:
- The coffee flavour is mild: if you prefer something stronger, increase to 4 tablespoons of instant coffee. The amount of boiling water remains the same.
- Chilling the dough makes it easier to handle: it will be sticky, so chill for 30 minutes or overnight before rolling. Lightly grease your hands with butter before rolling to prevent sticking. 
- For even results, weigh your dough balls: they should be about 45g each. The cookie dough can be frozen ahead of time.
- When icing the cookies: use pure icing sugar, not icing mixture, to prevent separation. For thicker icing, double the recipe.
- For a tiramisu-like cream layer: gently whip 125ml of thickened cream into the mascarpone icing mixture. Ice cookies just before serving.
- Storage: once iced, the cookies can be stored for two days. Store cookies without icing in an airtight container for up to five days.
