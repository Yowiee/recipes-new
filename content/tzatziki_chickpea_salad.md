## Ingredients

#### Tzatziki:
- 2 cucumbers , grated using a box grater, excess water squeezed out very well (3/4 cup once squeezed)
- 310 g Greek yogurt (or thick plain yogurt)
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 2.5 tbsp extra virgin olive oil , plus extra for drizzling
- 0.25 cup roughly chopped fresh dill , plus extra for sprinkling, or half the quantity chopped fresh mint
- 1 large garlic clove , crushed using garlic press
- 0.5 tsp cooking salt / kosher salt

#### Salad:
- 2 x 400g / 14 oz cans chickpeas , well drained
- 2 stems celery,  finely sliced
- 2 tbsp chopped capers (sub cornichons or dill pickles)

## Directions

1. Mix - Put the Tzatziki ingredients in a big bowl and mix. Add the chickpeas, celery and capers, mix again.
2. Wait 1 hour - You can eat it straight away but it's better if you can set aside for at least 1 hour to let the flavours meld (especially salt from capers & the garlic). It's even better the next day. Give it a taste and add a pinch of extra salt if needed (capers saltiness can differ).
3. Serve drizzled with extra olive oil and extra dill. Dive in!

#### Notes
1. Fresh dill - This really elevates this dish, so highly recommended! Mint is also excellent, but use half the quantity. Though if you don't fresh herbs or it's outrageously priced, substitute with green onion plus garlic and onion powder which gives it a ranch-dressing edge instead.
