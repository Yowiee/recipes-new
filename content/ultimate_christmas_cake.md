## Ingredients

#### FOR THE FRUIT
- 250g currants
- 250g sultanas
- 250g raisins
- 125g dried apricots, chopped
- 125g dried sour cherries or cranberries
- 125g pitted dates, chopped
- 125g pitted prunes, chopped
- 125g glace cherries, halved
- 125g mixed peel (or use half glace ginger)
- 100ml dark rum
- 100ml brandy
- 100ml strong black tea

#### FOR THE CAKE
- 250g plain flour
- ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
- 1½ tsp mixed spice
- 1½ tsp ground cinnamon
- ½ tsp finely grated fresh nutmeg
- ½ tsp fine sea salt
- 125g ground almonds
- 200g unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 70ml sunflower oil
- 200g dark brown sugar
- 100g caster sugar
- finely grated zest of 1 large orange
- 4 large eggs, lightly beaten
- 80g sour cream or thick yoghurt
- 150g slivered almonds
- 60ml brandy
60ml dark rum

## Directions

1. Place the dried fruits, including the cherries and mixed peel (and glace ginger, if using), in a large non-reactive bowl. Pour over the brandy, rum and cold tea, stir, cover and leave overnight or up to 2 days in a cool, dark place. Stir from time to time.
2. Grease and line a deep 23cm square (or round) cake tin with two layers of baking paper, extending it a little above the rim.
3. Preheat the oven to 130C fan-forced (150C conventional).
4. Sift the flour, bicarbonate of soda, spices and salt into a medium bowl, then add the ground almonds and whisk to incorporate. Set aside for now.
5. Place the butter, both sugars and orange zest in the bowl of an electric mixer and beat with the paddle attachment on medium-high speed until light and creamy, about 2 minutes. On medium-low speed, gradually add the oil, then the beaten eggs in a slow stream – the batter may look curdled at this stage but don’t worry, it will come together. Stop to scrape the bowl and beaters occasionally to ensure the batter is evenly mixed. Reduce the speed to low and add the sifted dry ingredients, about a quarter at a time, alternating with the soaked fruits. Finally, add the sour cream and slivered almonds, folding them through to combine.
6. Spoon the mixture into the prepared cake tin and level the top. Bake for 2 hours, then cover loosely with aluminium foil and continue to bake for another hour – a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake should come out clean when the cake is ready.
7. Combine the brandy and rum in a jug. When the cake comes out of the oven, immediately brush the alcohol evenly all over the top until it is absorbed. Cover the cake with a clean, dry tea-towel and allow it to cool slowly and completely in the cake tin.
8. When completely cooled, remove the cake from the baking tin, peel off the baking paper and rewrap it in fresh baking paper, then aluminium foil. Store the cake in an airtight container in a cool, dark place (not the fridge). For a stronger flavour, unwrap the cake and “feed” it once a week with a spoonful of alcohol brushed over the surface, then rewrap and store again.

#### Decorating the cake
When the cake has matured, you can decorate it for the table, choosing a decoration method to suit your style. Whichever method you choose – a creative arrangement of dried fruit and nuts, or marzipan, fondant and icing – start by applying a thin layer of warmed apricot jam to the surface, which acts as a glue.

For a jewel-like finish decorate the top a few days before Christmas with lightly toasted whole pecans or almonds, and whole dried fruit such as apricots, prunes and figs.
