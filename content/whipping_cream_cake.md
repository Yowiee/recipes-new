## Ingredients

- 225g (salted or unsalted) at room temperature
- 3 cups (600g) granulated sugar
- 6 eggs
- 3 cups (450g) all-purpose flour
- 1 cup heavy whipping cream
- 2 tablespoons vanilla extract

## Directions

1. Combine the butter and sugar in a large mixing bowl and beat with a large whisk until light and fluffy. Add one egg at a time, beating until fully combined after each addition.
2. Alternately add half of the flour and whipping cream, beating after each addition until everything is combined. Be careful not to whip the whipping cream. Stir in the vanilla extract. Try not to overmix the batter.
3. Scrape the batter into a 10-cup bundt pan—for insurance, grease and flour the pan.
4. Place the pan on the center rack of a cold oven and set the temperature to 325°F. Bake for one hour 15 minutes, testing for doneness by inserting a toothpick into the thickest part of the cake. When the toothpick slides out easily, and no wet bits remain on it, the cake is done.
5. Allow it to cool for 20 minutes before removing it from the pan. Then, let it cool completely on a wire rack before serving. Dust with powdered sugar, and enjoy!
