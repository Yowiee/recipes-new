6. Pour in the cooled water and gelatine and stir until combined.
7. Pour into the tin and put it into the fridge for at least an hour and a half to firm up.
8. Topping: Puree the mango flesh. Add the sugar and blitz again. There should be approximately 350ml of puree.
9. Combine water and gelatine.
10. Combine with mango puree and pour carefully over top of the cheesecake.
11. Refrigerate for 3 hours.
