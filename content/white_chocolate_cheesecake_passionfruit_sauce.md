## Ingredients

- 300g shortbread biscuits, crushed
- 125g unsalted butter, melted
- 150g white chocolate
- 3 gold-strength gelatine leaves (see note)
- 1/4 cup (60ml) milk
- 500g cream cheese, softened
- 395g can sweetened condensed milk
- 300ml thickened cream
- Pulp from 6 passionfruit (to give 3/4 cup)
- 125g caster sugar

## Directions

1. Grease a 23cm springform cake pan. Combine biscuits and butter, then press into base of cake pan. Chill for 30 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, place chocolate in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water (donâ€™t let the bowl touch the water), stirring until smooth. Cool to room temperature.
3. Soak the gelatine leaves in cold water for 5 minutes. Heat milk in a pan over medium-high heat until just below boiling point, then squeeze excess water from the gelatine leaves and add leaves to the hot milk, stirring until dissolved. Set aside.
4. Whiz cream cheese, condensed milk and milk mixture in a food processor until smooth. Add chocolate and pulse to combine. Whisk cream to soft peaks, then fold into chocolate mixture. Pour over biscuit base. Chill for 6 hours or overnight.
5. Meanwhile, pulse the passionfruit pulp in a food processor a few times to separate the pulp from the seeds. Strain, reserving seeds and juice, but discarding the pulpy flesh. Set aside.
6. Place sugar and 100ml cold water in a pan over low heat, stirring to dissolve sugar. Increase heat to medium-low and cook, swirling the pan occasionally and brushing down the sides with a damp pastry brush, for 5-6 minutes until a golden caramel. Add passionfruit juice and 1/4 cup (60ml) water (be careful as it may spit), reduce heat to low and stir until smooth. Cool slightly, then stir in the reserved seeds. Chill until ready to serve.
7. Serve the cheesecake drizzled with passionfruit sauce.
