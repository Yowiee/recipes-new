## Ingredients

#### Cake
- 240g (1 1/2 cups) wholemeal spelt flour
- 35g (1/3 cup) rolled oats
- 35g (1/3 cup) desiccated coconut
- 60g (1/3 cup) coconut sugar
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp bicarbonate of soda
- 130g (1/2 cup) Greek-style yoghurt
- 100ml light extra virgin olive oil
- 2 eggs
- 60ml (1/4 cup) honey, plus extra, to drizzle (optional)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 large, very ripe bananas, mashed
- 440g can crushed pineapple in juice, drained
- Toasted coconut flakes, to serve (optional)
- Lime zest, to serve (optional)

#### Cream cheese frosting
- 200g light cream cheese, at room temperature
- 70g (1/4 cup) Greek-style yoghurt
- 3 tsp honey
- 1 lime, rind finely grated

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 180C/160Â°C fan forced. Grease the base and side of a 22cm (base measurement) springform pan with oil and line with baking paper.
2. Combine the flour, oats, coconut, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon and bicarb in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre. Place yoghurt, oil, eggs, honey and vanilla in a jug. Use a fork to whisk to combine.
3. Add the yoghurt mixture, banana and pineapple to the well. Stir until well combined. Spoon into the prepared pan and smooth the surface. Bake for 40-45 minutes or until a skewer inserted in the centre of the cake comes out clean. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
4. For the frosting, place the cream cheese, yoghurt, honey and lime rind in a bowl. Use a wooden spoon to beat until smooth.
5. Spread frosting evenly over the cake. Drizzle with extra honey and sprinkle with coconut flakes and lime zest, if using.
