## Ingredients

- 3 cups all-purpose flour (360g)
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons cinnamon
- 3 large eggs
- 1 cup packed light or dark brown sugar (220g)
- ½ cup granulated sugar (100g)
- 1 cup vegetable oil (240mL)
- 4 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 3 cups grated zucchini (390g)
- 1½ cups chopped walnuts (180g)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 180°C. Line two 8×4-inch loaf pans with parchment paper or spray them with nonstick baking spray.
2. In a large bowl, whisk to combine the flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder, and cinnamon. (I always sift my dry ingredients, but it is not a must-do for this recipe.)
3. In a medium bowl, beat the eggs and both sugars until smooth and lightened in color. Add the oil and vanilla and whisk to combine. Fold in the grated zucchini.
4. Pour the wet mixture into the dry, then stir until only a few dry streaks of flour remain. Add the chopped walnuts and stir gently just until no dry streaks of flour remain.
5. Divide the batter evenly between the two loaf pans and spread it into an even layer.
6. Place loaf pans in the oven and turn down to 160°C.  Bake for 55 to 60 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the center of each loaf comes out clean.
7. Let the loaves cool in the pan for 5 to 10 minutes. Then, turn them out onto a cooling rack to cool completely.

#### Notes:
- Don’t overmix the batter. This will give you a too-dense loaf. After adding the chopped walnuts, mix just until no dry streaks of flour remain.
- Get creative with spices. Spices such as allspice, ginger, nutmeg, or cardamom work nicely in this bread. Add ¼ to ½ a teaspoon in addition to the cinnamon for a well-rounded flavor.
