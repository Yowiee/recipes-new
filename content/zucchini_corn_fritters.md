## Ingredients

- 2 zucchinis (about 350g), trimmed
- Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 90g plain flour
- 125g can corn kernels, drained, or 75g fresh corn kernels
- 3 spring onions, white and light green parts sliced
- 1 tbsp flat-leaf parsley, chopped
- 1 tbsp dill, finely chopped
- 80g feta, crumbled
- 1 egg
- 1 tsp chilli flakes (optional)
- 175ml extra virgin olive oil, for frying
- Lemon wedges, to serve

#### Salsa
- 1 avocado, diced
- 1 large ripe tomato, deseeded and diced
- 2 spring onions, white and light green parts sliced
- 1 tbsp flat-leaf parsley, chopped
- 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- Juice of ½ lemon
- Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

## Directions

1. Grate the zucchini into a bowl. Add a good pinch of salt and toss it through, then set aside for 20 minutes to draw out the liquid.
2. Spread the zucchini in the middle of a clean tea towel, roll it up, and twist and squeeze it out over the sink to remove as much of the liquid as possible.
3. Return the zucchini to the bowl and add the flour, corn, spring onion, herbs, feta, egg and chilli flakes (if using), season with salt and pepper and mix well.
4. Shape the mixture into eight patties – lightly oiling your hands will make this easier.
5. Combine all the salsa ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Taste for seasoning and adjust as needed. Set aside to allow the flavours to develop.
6. Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over medium to low heat, add three or four fritters and fry for 2 to 3 minutes on each side until golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towel. Repeat until all fritters are cooked.
7. Serve the fritters topped with the salsa and lemon wedges.
