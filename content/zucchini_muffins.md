## Ingredients

- 2¼ cups all-purpose flour (270g)
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ¾ teaspoon baking soda
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- 1½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 2 large eggs
- ⅔ cup vegetable oil (160mL)
- ½ cup granulated sugar (100g)
- ½ cup brown sugar packed (110g)
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2½ cups grated zucchini (325g)

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 175°C. Line a 12 cup muffin tin with paper liners.
2. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.
3. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, oil, sugars, and vanilla until lightened in color and smooth.
4. Add the wet mixture and zucchini to the dry mixture and gently stir until combined and no dry streaks of flour remain. (The batter will be thick. The zucchini will continue to release moisture as the muffins bake.)
5. Use a triggered ice cream scooper to fill the muffin liners almost all of the way full. Bake for 24 to 26 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the muffins comes out clean.
6. Let the muffins cool for 5 minutes in the pan, then transfer them to a wire cooling rack to cool completely.
