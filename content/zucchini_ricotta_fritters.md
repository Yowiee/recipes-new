## Ingredients

- 2 cups grated zucchini (about two medium zucchini)
- 1 cup ricotta cheese, drained
- ½ cup all purpose flour
- 2 large eggs
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 tablespoons green onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper
- olive oil for frying (about a cup)
- lemon wedges for serving, optional

## Directions

1. Start by grating the zucchini using a box grater or a food processor. After grating, place the zucchini in a clean kitchen towel and squeeze out as much moisture as possible.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the grated and drained zucchini with the ricotta cheese, flour, eggs, grated Parmesan cheese, chopped green onion, minced garlic, baking powder, salt, and black pepper. Mix well until all the ingredients are thoroughly combined.
3. Heat a generous amount of olive oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. The oil should measure about half an inch deep in the pan.
4. Using a spoon or scoop, carefully drop portions of the zucchini ricotta mixture into the hot oil, gently flattening each portion with the back of the spoon to form a fritter shape.
5. Fry the fritters in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Cook each fritter for about 2-3 minutes on each side or until they are golden brown and crispy.
6. Once the fritters are cooked, transfer them to a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil. Top with a light sprinkle of kosher salt and squeeze of lemon juice.

#### Notes
Zucchini: squeezing the extra moisture from the zucchini is a crucial step to prevent the fritters from becoming soggy.
Ricotta: be sure to drain the ricotta before using if it appears very wet. 
Oil: I like to fry these in olive oil, but you can use canola or vegetable oil instead. 
Leftovers: store leftover fritters in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Reheat in the oven or air fryer.
