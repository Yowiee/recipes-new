## Ingredients

- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup peanut butter*
- 2/3 cup pure maple syrup
- 2 Tbsp avocado oil**
- 1 tsp pure vanilla extract
- 1 ½ cups oats
- 1/2 cup cocoa powder
- 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon optional
- 1/2 tsp sea salt
- 1 ½ cups chocolate chips

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 170°C and line a 9-inch cake pan with parchment paper.
2. Transfer the eggs, peanut butter, pure maple syrup, avocado oil, and vanilla extract (the wet ingredients) to a mixing bowl and stir well until everything is well-combined. Note: If your peanut butter has been sitting in the refrigerator rather than at room temperature, microwave it for 30-60 seconds, or until it stirs very easily.
3. Add the dry ingredients to the mixing bowl (oats, cocoa powder, ground cinnamon, and sea salt) and stir until everything is completely combined. Stir in the chocolate chips.
4. Transfer the cookie dough to the prepared pan and spread it into an even layer. If you’d like, you can sprinkle the top with extra chocolate chips.
5. Bake on the center rack of the preheated oven for 18 to 22 minutes, or until the cookie bars have set up. You can sprinkle the oatmeal bars with flaky sea salt if you’d like.
6. Allow the cookie bars to cool completely before slicing and serving.


#### Notes
1. I use unsweetened natural creamy peanut butter but any type of peanut butter will work as long as it is well-stirred. I don’t recommend using a reduced fat peanut butter, as the bars will turn out dry and not as flavorful.
2. You can also use melted coconut oil or 4 tablespoons of melted butter.
